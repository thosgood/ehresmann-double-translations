    We also repeat here a few comments on notation from \cite[Comments on Part III-1, p.~337--338]{coll}, since there are a few conventions that the modern reader might find confusing.
    Categories are thought of as \emph{classes} equipped with a composition, so they are named by their morphisms instead of their objects, e.g. $\MM$ for ``maps'' instead of $\mathsf{Set}$, and $\FF$ for ``functors'' instead of $\mathsf{Cat}$.
    With this in mind, a category is often denoted by $\CC^\bullet$, where $\CC$ is its class of morphism and $\bullet$ is its composition operator; the class of its objects is written $\CC_0^\bullet$ and objects are often identified with their identity morphisms, and called \emph{units}.
    The domain and codomain of a morphism are denoted by $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (respectively).
    Functors $F$ from a category $\CC$ to a category $\CC'$ are written as $(\CC',F,\CC)$ (i.e. in the ``diagrammatic'' direction), and similarly for morphisms; the Hom functor is accordingly written $\CC(e',e)$.

\section*{Introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{\protect\numberline{}Introduction}

\oldpage{349}

This article is the first part of a work on the notion of structured categories and of species of structured structures.
The main results are summarised in a series in \emph{Notes à l'Académie des Sciences} \cite{3e}.

The first section begins with a short reminder on the notions of species of structures and categories of homomorphisms.
Let $(\CC,p,\HH,\SS)$ be a category of homomorphisms over $\CC$ such that $\SS$ contains the groupoid of invertible elements of the category $\HH$, and such that $\CC$ is further endowed with the structure of an inductive category.
We define the substructures of a structure of $\HH$.
This notion makes precise that of a sub-object of an arbitrary category, using the fact that $\HH$ is a category of homomorphisms and $\CC$ an inductive category;
\comm{21.1}{This notion of substructure is simplified in subsequent papers (\cite{coll61,coll66,coll69}), where it is freed from any order on $\CC$.}%
it leads to endowing $\HH$ with the structure of an ordered category, which is the subject of the main results of this section.

Let $(\MM,p,\HH,\Gamma)$ be a category of homomorphisms with finite products, over a category $\MM$ of maps;
we define, at the start of Section~II, $\HH$-structured categories (or, more precisely, $\HH(\HH',\HH'')$-structured categories).
\comm{21.2}{Structured categories are, in a more modern language, categories internal to a concrete category $\KK$ such that the ``internal'' source, target, and composition can be \todo}%
We then give a certain number of examples: topological categories and differential categories \cite{3b}; double categories that arise, in particular, in the theory of natural transformations between functors \cite{3d}; order-structured categories, in particular inductive categories and inductive groupoids \cite{3c}, etc.
\oldpage{350}
These examples, which I was led to consider in the study of fibred spaces, foliated spaces, extensions of differential varieties, and local structures in general, are the origin of this work.
The end of Section~II contains a series of general theorems:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\HH$-structured functors form a category of homomorphisms over a category of functors, and over $\MM$;
    it has finite products and is right solving.
  \item Let $(\CC^\bullet,s)$ be an $\HH$-structured category;
    if $\bar{\CC}^\bullet$ is a subcategory of $\CC^\bullet$, and $\bar{s}$ a substructure of $s$ such that $p(\bar{s})=\bar{C}$, then $(\bar{C}^\bullet,\bar{s})$ is an $\HH$-structured category.
  \item If $(\CC^\bullet,s)$ is an $\HH$-structured category, then the categories of \todo of $\CC^\bullet$ are $\HH$-structured categories.
\end{itemize}

All of these theorems use the additional hypothesis that $(\MM,p,\HH,\Gamma)$ is a right-solving category of homomorphisms (that is, $\HH$ contains ``enough'' substructures).
\comm{22.1}{A faithful set-valued functor is right solving if and only if it creates canonical equalisers (cf. Comment~221.2 on \cite{coll100}).}%

The second part of this article (to appear soon) will contain the theory of species of structured structures;
\comm{22.2}{This second part has not been developed, but only sketched in four notes: \cite{coll89,coll90,coll95,coll96}.}%
we will show how the complete enlargement procedure of an inductive groupoid can be generalised to species of structured structures.
We will then give some applications of all these concepts to more specific problems.



\section{Categories of homomorphisms and substructures}
\label{section:i}

\subsection{Conventions}
\label{section:i.1}

A category will be in general represented by the symbol denoted the underlying class (or \emph{support}) of the category along with the symbol for the composition law that makes this class a category as a superscript.
For example: $\CC^\perp$, $\CC_1^\perp$, $\bar{\CC}^\perp$ (resp. $\CC^\bullet$, $\CC_1^\bullet$, $\bar{\CC}^\bullet$), \ldots denote the categories obtained by endowing the class $\CC$, $\CC_1$, $\bar{\CC}$, \ldots with the composition law $\perp$ (resp. $\bullet$).
The class of units of a category will be denoted by the symbol representing the category along with a $0$ as a subscript.
For example: $\CC_0^\perp$, $(\CC_1^\perp)_0$, $\bar{\CC}_0^\perp$, \ldots.
If a class of objects is naturally associated to the category (for example, the classes in a category of maps from one class to another), then we will tacitly identify the units with the corresponding objects.
\comm{22.4}{This identification must be considered as an abbreviation, not as a formal operation (cf. Comment~211.1 on \cite{coll100}).}%

Let $\CC^\perp$ be a category.
The source and target maps that send an element $f\in\CC^\perp$ to its right and left units will be denoted $\alpha^\perp$ and $\beta^\perp$ (respectively).
The class of pairs $(g,f)$ such that the composite $g\perp f$ is defined (that is, such that $\alpha^\perp(g)=\beta^\perp(f)$) will be denoted by the symbol $\CC^\perp\star\CC^\perp$;
the map
\[
  (g,f) \longmapsto g\perp f
  \qquad\text{where $(g,f\in\CC^\perp\star\CC^\perp)$}
\]
will be denoted by the symbol $\comp^\perp$.

\oldpage{351}
To simplify notation, if no confusion is possible, we will represent a category by the same symbol as its underlying class;
in this case, it is to be understood that the composition law is denoted by $\bullet$;
we thus write $\CC$ instead of $\CC^\bullet$.
Similarly, we will also write $\CC_0$, $\alpha$, and $\beta$ instead of $\CC_0^\bullet$, $\alpha^\bullet$, and $\beta^\bullet$ (respectively).

Let $\bar{C}^\perp$ and $\CC^\perp$ be two categories;
the word ``functor'' will always mean a contravariant functor.
A functor from $\CC^\perp$ to $\bar{\CC}^\perp$ will be denoted either by a triple $(\bar{\CC}^\perp,F,\CC^\perp)$, where $F$ is the corresponding map, or by just the letter $F$.
The restriction of $F$ to the class $\CC_0^\perp$, considered as a map from $\CC_0^\perp$ to $\bar{\CC}_0^\perp$, will be denoted $F_0$.



\subsection{Reminder on species of structures}
\label{section:i.2}

Since the notion of species of structures \cite{3a} is essential in this article, we will recall the definition and main properties.

\begin{rmenv}{Definition 1}
\label{definition:i-1}
  We say that a category $\CC$ is a \emph{category of operators on a class $\Sigma_0$} if we have defined a composition law $(f,z)\mapsto fz$ for certain pairs $(f,z)\in\CC\times\Sigma_0$ such that $fz\in\Sigma_0$ and such that the following axioms are satisfied:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[\normalfont(1)]
      \emph{Associativity.}
      If one of $g(fz)$ or $(g\bullet f)z$ is defined, then both of them are defined, and
      \[
        g(fz)
        = (g\bullet f)z;
      \]
    \item[\normalfont(2)]
      If $g\bullet f$ and $fz$ are defined, then $g(fz)$ is defined;
    \item[\normalfont(3)]
      Let $e\in\CC_0$;
      if $ez$ is defined, then $ez=z$;
    \item[\normalfont(4)]
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item[(a)]
          For all $z\in\Sigma_0$, there exists at least one $f\in\CC$ such that $fz$ is defined;
        \item[(b)]
          For all $f\in\CC$, there exists at least one $z\in\Sigma_0$ such that $fz$ is defined.
      \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{rmenv}

\todo{fix the spacing before the corner symbol in the above rmenv}

These axioms imply that, for all $z\in\Sigma_0$, there exists exactly one $e\in\CC_0$ such that $ez$ is defined;
we thus obtain a map $p_0\colon z\mapsto e$ from $\Sigma_0$ to $\CC_0$;
we say that $z$ is a \emph{structure} on $p_0(z)$.

\begin{rmenv}{Definition 2}
\label{definition:i-2}
  Let $\Sigma_0$ be a class, and $\CC$ a category;
  we say that $\Sigma_0$ is a \emph{species of structures over $\CC$} if we have a subcategory $\CC_1$ of $\CC$ that is a category of operators on $\Sigma_0$;
  let $p_0$ be the corresponding map from $\Sigma_0$ to $\CC_0$;
  we also say that $(\CC,p_0,\Sigma_0)$ is a \emph{species of structures}.
  If, further, $\CC_1=\CC$, then we say that $[\CC,p_0,\Sigma_0]$ is a \emph{species of structures on $\CC$}.
\end{rmenv}

Let $(\CC,p_0,\Sigma_0)$ be a species of structures.
Let $\Sigma$ be the class of pairs $(f,z)\in\CC\times\Sigma_0$ such that $fz$ is defined, i.e. such that $\alpha(f)=p_0(z)$.

\begin{longcomm}{23.1}
  This ``i.e.'' is not correct: if $fz$ exists, then $\alpha(f)=p_0(z)$;
  but the converse is not true.
  For instance, if $\CC_1$ is the groupoid of isomorphisms of $\CC$, then the assertion is valid only if the acting category is $\CC$ itself.
  Hence the notion of a \emph{strong species of structures}: a species of structures in which the acting subcategory contains each $f$ whose source is in it;
  equivalently, the composite $fz$ exists if and only if $\alpha(f)=p_0(z)$.

  Strong species of structures are characterised by axioms~(1), (2), (3), and (4a) --- but not (4b) --- of \hyperref[definition:i-1]{Definition~1} for an acting category (cf. \hyperref[remark:i-2]{Remark~2} in \hyperref[section:i.3]{§I.3}).
  The corresponding functor $p\colon\Sigma\to\CC$ from the hypermorphisms category satisfies the condition that the diagram
  \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
      \Sigma_0
        \ar[d,swap,"p_0"]
      & \Sigma
        \ar[l]
        \ar[d]
    \\\CC_0
      & \CC
        \ar[l,"\alpha"]
    \end{tikzcd}
  \]
  is a pullback (which is somewhat stronger than condition~(E) below);
  in more modern language, this means that $p$ is a discrete opfibration.
  Conversely, each discrete opfibration determines a strong species of structures.
\end{longcomm}

Endowed with the composition law
\[
  (f',z')\bullet(f,z)
  = (f'\bullet f,z)
  \quad\text{if and only if}\quad
  z'=fz,
\]
\oldpage{352}
$\Sigma$ is a category, called the \emph{associated category of hypermorphisms} of the species of structures $(\CC,p_0,\Sigma_0)$.
The class of units of $\Sigma$ can be identified with $\Sigma_0$ by associating $(e,z)$ with $z$.
The map $p_0$ extends to a functor $(\CC,p,\Sigma)$ satisfying the following property:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[\normalfont(E)] \itshape
    For all $h\in\Sigma$ and all $z\in\Sigma_0$ such that
    \[
      p_0(z)
      = p_0(\alpha(h))
    \]
    there exists exactly one $h'\in\Sigma$ such that
    \[
      p(h')=p(h)
      \quad\text{and}\quad
      \alpha(h')=z.
    \]
\end{enumerate}
The species of structures $(\CC,p_0,\Sigma_0)$ is also denoted by $(\CC,p,\Sigma)$.

Conversely, let $\CC$ and $\Sigma$ be two categories.
Let $(\CC,p,\Sigma)$ be a functor satisfying condition~(E);
we say that $\Sigma$ is a \emph{category over $\CC$ with respect to $p$}.
We can show \cite{3a} that $p(\Sigma)$ is a subcategory of $\CC$, and that the map
\[
  h\longmapsto \big(p(h),\alpha(h)\big)
\]
lets us identify $\Sigma$ with the associated category of hypermorphisms of the species of structures $(\CC,p_0,\Sigma_0)$ in which the composition law is defined by
\[
  (f,z) \longmapsto \beta(h)
\]
if and only if there exists $h\in\Sigma$ such that
\[
  f=p(h)
  \quad\text{and}\quad
  z=\alpha(h).
\]



\subsection{Species of structures dominated by a category}
\label{section:i.3}

We denote by $\MM_0$ a class of classes such that if it contains $X$ then it also contains all the subsets of $X$.

\begin{longcomm}{24.1}
  The set-theoretical assumptions here are not explicit (cf. also Comment~155.1 on \cite{coll66} and Comment~211.2 on \cite{coll100}).
  Charles was very conscious of the problem.
  For instance, he suggested such foundational questions as a thesis subject to Houdebine \cite{comm55}, pointing out Quine's theory of types \cite{comm87}.
  Later on, he was much interested by Lawvere's category-based theory \cite{comm64}.

  In fact, Charles' conception on this subject evolved from 1957 to 1967: in \cite{coll47} he wanted to speak about ``the category $\widetilde{\mathcal{E}}$ of all sets'', whence the (not too formal) distinction between classes and sets, as in Bernays--Gödel theory \cite{comm10}.
  In \cite{coll55}, as well as this 1963 paper, logical problems are avoided thanks to the use of a ``class $\MM_0$ of classes'';
  Charles thought of $\MM_0$ as a ``large enough'' variable set (and the word ``class'' is used to indicate that no particular set theory is adopted), on which conditions are added when necessary (for instance, $\MM_0$ is closed under products and subsets in \hyperref[section:ii]{§II});
  in \cite{coll66,coll100}, $\MM_0$ must be closed under quotients and countable coproducts.
  From \cite{coll109} onwards, $\MM_0$ becomes a universe.

  Note that the letter $\MM$ was really chosen to stress the variability of the class (in geometry, a variable point is often denoted by $M$...);
  but we thought of two other interpretations of this letter: ``Mengen'' in German, and ``maps'' in English;
  and the latter is well suited since later texts are written in English, and we liked to name a category by its morphisms instead of its objects.
\end{longcomm}

Then $\MM_0$ can be identified with a class of units of the category $\MM$ whose elements are triples $(M',f,M)$ such that $M,M'\in\MM_0$ and $f$ is a surjection from $M$ onto a subclass of $M'$, and with the composition law defined by
\[
  (M'',f',M'_1)\bullet(M',f,M)
  = (M'',f'f,M)
  \quad\text{if and only if}\quad
  M'_1=M'
\]
where $f'f$ denotes the surjection
\[
  x\longmapsto f'(f(x)).
\]
If $\bar{f}=(M',f,M)$, then we also write $\bar{f}(x)$ to mean $f(x)$.

Let $(\CC,p,\Sigma)$ be a species of structures such that $p^{-1}(e)$ belongs to $\MM_0$ for all $e\in p_0(\Sigma_0)$.
Let $f\in p(\Sigma)$ and set
\[
  \begin{aligned}
    e&=\alpha(f),
  \\e'&=\beta(f).
  \end{aligned}
\]
Set
\[
  F(f)
  = \big(p^{-1}(e'),\widetilde{f},p^{-1}(e)\big)
  \in\MM
\]
\oldpage{353}
where
\[
  \widetilde{f}(z)
  =fz
  \qquad\text{for all $z$ such that $p(z)=e$;}
\]
then $F(e)$ can be identified with $p^{-1}(e)$.
If $f$ is an invertible element of $p(\Sigma)$, then the map $\widetilde{f}$ is a bijection from $F(e)$ to $F(e')$.
The map $F\colon f\mapsto F(f)$ for $f\in p(\Sigma)$ is a functor from $\alpha(F)=p(\Sigma)$ to $\MM$ satisfying the axiom
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(A)] \itshape
    Let $e,e'\in\alpha(F)_0$; then
    \[
      F(e)\neq\varnothing;
    \]
    further, if $e\neq e'$ then
    \[
      F(e)\cap F(e')=\varnothing.
    \]
\end{enumerate}
Furthermore, the pair $(\CC,F)$ entirely determines $(\CC,p,\Sigma)$.

Conversely, let $(\CC,F)$ be a pair such that $F$ is a functor from a subcategory $\alpha(F)$ of $\CC$ to $\MM$ satisfying condition~(A).
We can show \cite{3a} that the class $\Sigma_0$, given by the union of the classes $F(e)$ over all $e\in\alpha(F)_0$, is a species of structures over $\CC$, in which the composition law is defined by
\[
  (f,z)\longmapsto F(f)(z)
  \quad\text{if and only if}\quad
  z\in F(\alpha(f)).
\]
We say that $(\CC,F)$ is a \emph{a pair defining a species of structures}, namely the species of structures $\Sigma_0$ constructed above.

\begin{rmenv}{Remarks}
  ---
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[\normalfont(1)]
    \label{remark:i-1}
      Let $\CC$ be a category, $\alpha(F)$ a subcategory, and $(\MM,F,\alpha(F))$ a functor.
      Let $\bar{F}$ be the functor that sends $f\in\alpha(F)$ to the map
      \[
        (\alpha(f),z)
        \longmapsto\big(\beta(f),F(f)(z)\big)
        \qquad\text{where $z\in F(\alpha(f))$.}
      \]
      The pair $(\CC,\bar{F})$ defines the species of structures $(\CC,p_0,\Sigma_0)$, where $\Sigma_0$ is the class of pairs $(e,z)$ such that $e\in\alpha(F)_0$, $z\in F(e)$, and
      \[
        p_0(e,z)=e.
      \]
    \item[\normalfont(2)]
    \label{remark:i-2}
      Let $(\CC,F)$ be a pair defining a species of structures $(\CC,p,\Sigma)$ such that $\alpha(F)$ contains $f\in\CC$ whenever $\alpha(f)\in\alpha(F)$;
      this is equivalent to saying that we are given a composition law between the category $\CC$ and the class $\Sigma_0$ that satisfies axioms~(1), (2), (3), and (4a) of Definition 1.
      We can extend $F$ to a functor $(\MM,\bar{F},\CC)$ given by
      \[
        \begin{aligned}
          \bar{F}(f)&=F(f)
          \qquad&&\text{for all $f\in\alpha(F)$;}
        \\\bar{F}(e)&=\varnothing
          \qquad&&\text{for all $e\in\CC_0$ and $e\not\in\alpha(F)_0$;}
        \\\bar{F}(f')&=\big(\bar{F}(\beta(f')),\varnothing,\varnothing)
          \qquad&&\text{for all $f'\not\in\alpha(F)$.}
        \end{aligned}
      \]
    \item[\normalfont(3)]
    \label{remark:i-3}
      Let $\CC^\bullet$ be a category;
      the triple $(\CC^\bullet,\beta,\CC)$ is a species of structures for the composition law $\bullet$;
      if $e\in\CC_0^\bullet$ then the triple $(\CC^\bullet,\beta,\alpha^{-1}(e))$ is a sub-species of structures \cite{3a} of $(\CC^\bullet,\beta,\CC)$.
      \comm{25.2}{The set-valued functor associated to $(\CC^\bullet,\beta,\alpha^{-1}(e))$ is the partial Hom functor $\Hom(e,-)\colon\CC\to\mathsf{Set}$.}%
  \end{enumerate}
\end{rmenv}

\begin{longcomm}{25.1}
  \emph{Motivations for (internal) actions.}

  Charles first met (topological or differentiable) actions of categories (more precisely, of groupoids) in his theory of fibre bundles: in \cite{coll28} in 1950, he shows that, if $E$ is a fibre bundle, then the groupoid $S$ of isomorphisms from fibre to fibre, equipped with its canonical topology, acts (continuously) on the total space of $E$, and the fibre bundles associated to $E$ are those spaces on which $S$ acts.
  So (\cite{coll50}) the category of fibre bundles is equivalent to the category of actions of ``locally trivial groupoids'', which are some concrete internal groupoids in the category of topological spaces.
  The category of principal fibre bundles is equivalent to the category of locally trivial groupoids.

  Almost simultaneously (\cite{coll39}), he came upon ``local species of structures'' (i.e. internal species of structures in the category of local classes) in his attempt to unify the treatment of structures defined by a ``gluing together'' process.

  In 1957, these examples led him to introduce acting categories and species of structures (\cite{coll47}).
  He chose the latter term in reference to Bourbaki's species of structures, whose ``transport by isomorphism of structures'' is so axiomatised;
  indeed, at that time, Charles was most preoccupied by ``good'' definitions of structures.

  In \cite{coll47}, he proves equivalences between three notions: species of structures, hypermorphisms functors, and set-valued functors satisfying condition~(A) above.
  He also gives the enlargement theorem for species of structures (cf. Comment~29.2) which is equivalent to the Kan extension theorem (\cite{comm58}, published the year after) for set-valued functors, except that the problem is looked at ``upside-down'', with the set-valued functor being replaced by the associated hypermorphisms functor (and this led to the more general theorems on extension of functors in \cite{coll77,coll122}).
  He uses this enlargement theorem as the first step in his construction of the important ``complete enlargement'' of a local species of structures, the structures of which are defined by atlases;
  the second step consists of a generalisation of the associated sheaf theorem to presheaves over a local class, thanks to an original method (extended in \cite{coll110} to local functors).
  Locally homogeneous spaces, differentiable or analytic or foliated manifolds, fibre bundles, \ldots are obtained as particular cases.

  In \cite{coll55}, Charles explicitly says that the category of species of structures with covariant maps is:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item equivalent to the category of functors satisfying condition~(E) above, with square of functors as morphisms;

    \item isomorphic to the category of pairs defining a species of structures, with a morphism $(\Phi,\phi)\colon(\CC,F)\to(\CC,F')$ being defined by
      \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
          &&\MM
        \\& \ar[ur,"F'"] \ar[dl]
          && \ar[ul,swap,"F",""{below,name=F}] \ar[dr,"\iota"] \ar[ll,from=F,Rightarrow,bend left=10,"\phi"]
        \\\CC'
          &&&& \CC \ar[llll,"\Phi"]
        \end{tikzcd}
      \]
      where $\phi\colon F\to F'\Phi\iota$ is a natural transformation;

    \item equivalent to the category of pairs $(\CC,F)$, where $F$ is a set-valued functor whose domain is a sub-category of $\CC$.
  \end{itemize}

  These equivalences restrict (\hyperref[remark:i-2]{Remarks~1 and 2}, and Comment~23.1) to equivalences between the categories of strong species of structures, of discrete opfibrations, and of set-valued functors.

  Topological, differentiable, and local species of structures are instances of structured (or ``concrete internal'') species of structures, which are defined in \cite{coll59,coll60} by ``lifting'' the action along the forgetful functor of a concrete category;
  enlargement theorems for them are given in \cite{coll89,coll90,coll95,coll96}.
  In fact, sketches in the sense of \cite{coll106} are easily drawn, the set models of which are species of structures and discrete opfibrations \cite{coll117};
  the models in a category $\KK$ are \emph{internal species of structures} and \emph{internal discrete opfibrations} (also called \emph{internal diagrams} or \emph{internal presheaves}, cf. Johnstone \cite{comm56}).
  Thanks to the equivalences indicated above, this provides an ``internalisation'' of the ``external'' notion of set-valued functor, by looking at it ``upside-down'';
  Charles already stressed this fact in his lectures in the early sixties.
  This probably did inspire Bénabou, who was one of the first categorists to apply it (in his definition of internal distributors \cite{comm7}).
  The development of topos theory led other categorists to adopt (or rediscover) this point of view some ten years later (cf. MacLane's analysis of Johnstone's book \cite{comm75}).
\end{longcomm}

\oldpage{354}
Let $(\CC^\bullet,F_e)$ be the pair defining the species of structures $(\CC^\bullet,\beta,\alpha^{-1}(e))$, and $\bar{F}_e$ the functor associated to $F_e$ by \hyperref[remark:i-2]{Remark~2} above.
A functor $(\MM,G,\CC^\bullet)$ is said to be representable \cite{2} if there exists some $e\in\CC_0^\bullet$ such that $G$ and $\bar{F}_e$ are induced from one another by a natural equivalence.
To every pair $(\CC,F)$ that defines a species of structures $(\CC,p,\Sigma)$, we can associated a representable functor $\bar{F}$ in the following way:

Let $a$ be an arbitrary element that does not belong to $\CC$.
Let $\CC'_1$ be the class of pairs $(z,a)$, where $z\in\Sigma_0$.
Let $\CC'$ be the class given by the union of $\CC$, $\{a\}$, and $\CC'_1$.
This class is a category for the composition law
\[
  (\gamma',\gamma)
  \longmapsto\gamma'\bullet\gamma
\]
if and only if one of the following conditions is satisfied:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[\normalfont(1)]
    $\gamma,\gamma'\in\CC$ and $\alpha(\gamma')=\beta(\gamma)$;
    then $\gamma'\bullet\gamma$ is the composition of $\gamma'$ and $\gamma$ in $\CC$;
  \item[\normalfont(2)]
    $\gamma'\in\CC$, $\gamma=(z,a)$, and $z\in F(\alpha(\gamma'))$;
    then
    \[
      \gamma'\bullet\gamma
      =(\gamma'z,a)
    \]
  \item[\normalfont(3)]
    $\gamma'=(z,a)$ and $\gamma=a$;
    then
    \[
      \gamma'\bullet\gamma
      =(z,a).
    \]
\end{enumerate}
\hyperref[remark:i-2]{Remark~2} then allows us to extend $F$ to a functor $(\MM,\bar{F},\CC')$;
this functor $\bar{F}$, which is identical to $(\MM,\bar{F}_a,\CC')$, is representable.\comm{26.1}{Regarding $\CC'$, Bénabou gives the following criterion: $F\colon\CC\to\SS$ is representable if and only if $\CC\hookrightarrow\CC'$ has a left adjoint \cite{comm5}.}

\begin{rmenv}{Definition 3}
\label{definition:i-3}
  Let $\CC$ be a category, and $(\MM,\gamma,\KK)$ a functor.
  We define a \emph{species of structures dominated by $(\gamma,\KK)$} to be a pair $(\CC,F)$ such that $(\KK,F,\alpha(F))$ is a functor and $(\CC,\gamma F)$ defines a species of structures;
  the species of structures defined by $(\CC,\gamma F)$ is called the \emph{species of structures under $(\CC,F)$}.
\end{rmenv}

\begin{longcomm}{26.2}
  \emph{Enriched species of structures.}

  Analysis problems prompted us to introduce $\gamma$-dominated species of structures (in \cite{comm28}).

  If $\CC$ is a category, and if the species of structures defined by the Hom functor is dominated by $(\gamma,\KK)$, then $\CC$ is called a \emph{$\gamma$-dominated} category \cite{coll77}.
  A refinement of this notion, namely that of a \emph{strongly $\gamma$-dominated} category from \cite{coll104,coll109}, is equivalent to the notion of a $\KK$-category (cf. \cite{comm31}) when $\KK$ is a concrete cartesian category.

  A fine study of dominated categories is due to Foltz \cite{comm33}.

  More generally, let $\mathbf{V}$ be a monoidal category.
  Then a {$\mathbf{V}$-species of structures} may be defined by the following data:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item a $\mathbf{V}$-category $\mathbf{C}$,

    \item for each object $e$ of $\mathbf{C}$, an object $F(e)$ of $\mathbf{V}$,

    \item for each pair $(e',e)$ of objects of $\mathbf{C}$, a morphism $k'_{e',e}\colon\mathbf{C}(e',e)\otimes F(e)\to F(e')$ satisfying the identity and associativity axioms, which are given by asking for the diagrams
    \[
      \begin{tikzcd}
        F(e)
          \ar[r,"k'_{e,e}"]
        & \mathbf{C}(e,e)\otimes F(e)
      \\I\otimes F(e)
          \ar[u,"\sim"{anchor=south,rotate=90}]
          \ar[ur,swap,"i_e\otimes F(e)"]
      \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    \[
      \begin{tikzcd}
        & F(e'')
        & \mathbf{C}(e'',e)\otimes F(e)
          \ar[l,swap,"k'_{e'',e}"]
      \\\mathbf{C}(e'',e')\otimes F(e')
          \ar[ur,"k'_{e'',e'}"]
      \\& \mathbf{C}(e'',e')\otimes\big(\mathbf{C}(e',e)\otimes F(e)\big)
          \ar[ul,"{\mathbf{C}(e'',e')\otimes k'_{e',e}}"]
        & \big(\mathbf{C}(e'',e')\otimes\mathbf{C}(e',e)\big)\otimes F(e)
          \ar[l,swap,"\sim","\mathrm{assoc.}"{below}]
          \ar[uu,swap,"k_{e'',e',e}\otimes F(e)"]
      \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    to commute, where $I$ is the unit of $\otimes$, and where $i_{(-)}$ and $k_{(-,-,-)}$ are the identity and associativity morphisms (respectively).
  \end{itemize}
  
  Suppose that $\mathbf{V}$ is a cartesian category with commuting coproducts, and that $I$ is connected (in the sense of Penon \cite{comm83}).
  In \cite[Appendix]{coll120}, we proved that the category of $\mathbf{V}$-categories (with small enough classes of objects) is equivalent to the category of internal category whose object of objects is a coproduct of copies of $I$.
  Similarly:

  \begin{itenv}{Proposition~A}
    The category of $\mathbf{V}$-species of structures is equivalent to the category of pseudo-discrete internal species of structures in $\mathbf{V}$ (where pseudo-district means that the object of structures is the coproduct of the fibres).
  \end{itenv}

  Now let $(\CC,F)$ be a species of structures dominated by $(\mathbf{V},\gamma)$, where $\gamma=\Hom(I,-)$.
  If $\gamma$ admits a left adjoint that preserve products, then there exists a free $\mathbf{V}$-category $\mathbf{C}$ generated by $\CC$, and the $F(e)$ determine a ``free'' $\mathbf{V}$-species of structures over $\mathbf{C}$.
  Hence:

  \begin{itenv}{Proposition~B}
    The category of species of structures that are dominated by $(\mathbf{V},\gamma)$ is equivalent to the category of free $\mathbf{V}$-species of structures over a free $\mathbf{V}$-category.
  \end{itenv}

  So, in this case, the notion of internal species of structures encompasses the notions of enriched and dominated species of structures.
\end{longcomm}

We will later return to the notion of a species of structures dominated by a category (Sections~III and IV).
For now, we will only consider particular cases.

Let $\FF$ be the category of all functors $(\bar{\SS}^\bullet,G,\SS^\bullet)$ such that $(\bar{\SS},G,\SS)\in\MM$;
let $(\MM,p_\FF,\FF)$ be the functor defined by
\[
  p_\FF\colon(\bar{\SS}^\bullet,G,\SS^\bullet)
  \longmapsto (\bar{\SS},G,\SS).
\]

\begin{rmenv}{Definition 4}
\label{definition:i-4}
  A species of structures dominated by $(p_\FF,\FF)$ is called a \emph{species of morphisms}.
\end{rmenv}

\begin{longcomm}{26.3}
  Species of morphisms are called ``category of categories'' in \cite{comm28}.
  They are studied in \cite{coll70,coll77,coll122}, alongside the associated opfibrations with a cleavage (constructed by adapting the construction of the cross product of group $A$ and an $A$-module), with a view to applications in non-abelian cohomology.

  General fibrations were introduced by Grothendieck in \cite{comm43} and studied by Gray in \cite{comm38}.
  Their present theory has been developed by looking at a fibration as a family of categories (by Lawvere \cite{comm65}, Bénabou--Celeyrette \cite{comm8,comm19}, and Paré--Schumacher \cite{comm82} who call them ``indexed categories'').
\end{longcomm}

Let $(\CC,p,\Sigma)$ be a species of structures.
Consider the following conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    $(\CC,p,\Sigma)$ is the species of structures under a species of morphisms $(\CC,F)$.
  \oldpage{355}
  \item[(b)]
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[(b\textsubscript{1})]
        For all $e\in p(\Sigma_0)$, the class $p^{-1}(e)$ is endowed with the structure of a category $(p^{-1}(e))^\perp$, which we denote by $F(e)$;
      \item[(b\textsubscript{2})]
        Let $f\in p(\Sigma)$, $e=\alpha(f)$, and $e'=\beta(f')$;
        then $(F(e'),\widetilde{f},F(e))$ is a functor $F(f)$.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item[(c)]
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[(c\textsubscript{1})]
        $(\Sigma_0)^\perp$ is a category;
      \item[(c\textsubscript{2})]
        If $(z',z)\in(\Sigma_0)^\perp\star(\Sigma_0)^\perp$ and $(f,z'\perp z)\in\Sigma$ then
        \[
          (f,z),(f,z')\in\Sigma
          \quad\text{and}\quad
          f(z'\perp z)=fz'\perp fz;
        \]
      \item[(c\textsubscript{3})]
        If $z_0\in(\Sigma_0)_0^\perp$ and $(f,z_0)\in\Sigma$, then
        \[
          fz_0\in(\Sigma_0)_0^\perp.
        \]
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itenv}{Proposition 1}
\label{proposition:i-1}
  Conditions~(a), (b), and (c) above are equivalent (where condition~(a) is interpreted independently from the choice of $\FF$).
\end{itenv}

\begin{proof}
  Conditions~(a) and (b) are equivalent by definition.
  If they are satisfied, then the category $(\Sigma_0)^\perp$ given by the sum of the categories $F(e)$ for $e\in p(\Sigma_0)$ satisfies condition~(c).
  Conversely, suppose that condition~(c) is satisfied.
  Let $z,z'\in\Sigma_0$.
  If $z'\perp z$ is defined, then $p(z'\perp z)$ \unsure{typo?} is defined and, by (c\textsubscript{2}), we have
  \[
    p(z'\perp z)
    = p(z')
    = p(z);
  \]
  in particular,
  \[
    p(\alpha^\perp(z))
    = p(\beta^\perp(z))
    = p(z);
  \]
  thus $p^{-1}(e)$ is a subcategory of $(\Sigma_0)^\perp$ for all $e\in p(\Sigma_0)$.
  Let $f\in p(\Sigma)$ be such that $\alpha(f)=e$;
  conditions~(c\textsubscript{2}) and (c\textsubscript{3}) imply that the map $\widetilde{f}$ is a functor from $p^{-1}(e)$ to $p^{-1}(\beta(f))$.
  Thus (b) is satisfied.
\end{proof}

\begin{itenv}{Corollary}
  If we suppose conditions~(c\textsubscript{1}) and (c\textsubscript{2}) to be satisfied, and if $p(\Sigma)$ (resp. $\Sigma_0^\perp$) is a groupoid, then condition~(c\textsubscript{3}) is also satisfied.
\end{itenv}

\begin{proof}
  If $(f,z_0)\in\Sigma$ and $z_0\in(\Sigma_0)_0^\perp$ then
  \[
    fz_0
    = f(z_0\perp z_0)
    =fz_0\perp fz_0.
  \]
  If $(\Sigma_0)^\perp$ is a groupoid, then it follows that $fz_0\in(\Sigma_0)_0^\perp$.
  Suppose that $p(\Sigma)$ is a groupoid;
  from the sequence of equalities
  \[
    \begin{aligned}
      f^{-1}(fz_0)
      &= f^{-1}(fz_0\perp\alpha^\perp(fz_0))
    \\&= (f^{-1}\bullet f)z_0\perp f^{-1}(\alpha^\perp(fz_0))
    \\&= f^{-1}(\alpha^\perp(fz_0))
    \end{aligned}
  \]
  we deduce that
  \[
    fz_0
    = \alpha^\perp(fz_0)
    \in(\Sigma_0)_0^\perp
  \]
  and so (c\textsubscript{3}) is satisfied.
\end{proof}

Let $A$ be a class endowed with an order relation $<$;
the class of pairs $(z',z)$ with $z<z'$ is a category under the composition law given by
\[
  (z'',z'_1)\perp(z',z)
  =(z'',z)
  \quad\text{if and only if}\quad
  z'_1=z'.
\]
\oldpage{356}
Conversely, if $\CC$ is a category such that any two elements $f,f'\in\CC$ that have the same set of units in $\CC$ are identical, then the data of $\CC$ defines on $\CC_0$ the order relation given by
\[
  \begin{gathered}
    z<z'
    \qquad\text{if and only if there exists $f\in\CC$ such that}
  \\z=\alpha(f)
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    z'=\beta(f).
  \end{gathered}
\]
We then say that the category $\CC$ \emph{defines} an \emph{order} on $\CC$.

Let $\Omega_0$ be the class of ordered classes $(A,<)$, where $A\in\MM_0$;
let $\widetilde{\Omega}$ be the category of triples $((A',<),h,(A,<))$, where $(A,<),(A',<)\in\Omega_0$ and where $h$ is a map from $A$ to $A'$ that is compatible with the orders on $A$ and $A'$.
Let $\omega$ be the map
\[
  \big((A',<),h,(A,<)\big)
  \longrightarrow (A',h,A);
\]
then $(\MM,\omega,\widetilde{\Omega})$ is a functor.

\begin{rmenv}{Definition 5}
\label{definition:i-5}
  If a species of structures $(\CC,F)$ is dominated by $(\omega,\widetilde{\Omega})$, then we call it an \emph{ordered species of structures} \unsure{or species of ordered structures?};
  if $\CC$ further defines an order on $\CC_0$, then we say that $(\CC,F)$ is a \emph{bi-ordered species of structures} \unsure{again, which noun does bi-ordered modify?}.
\end{rmenv}

Let $((\bar{A},<),h,(A,<))\in\widetilde{\Omega}$;
let $\AA$ (resp. $\bar{\AA}$) be the category of pairs defining the order of $A$ (resp. of $\bar{A}$);
let $\bar{h}$ be the map
\[
  (z',z)
  \longmapsto(h(z'),h(z))
  \qquad\text{where $(z',z)\in\AA$;}
\]
then $(\bar{\AA},\bar{h},\AA)$ is a functor, and the map
\[
  \eta\colon\big((\bar{A},<),h,(A,<)\big)
  \longmapsto(\bar{\AA},\bar{h},\AA)
\]
is an equivalence from $\widetilde{\Omega}$ to a full subcategory $\widehat{\Omega}$ of $\FF$ whose units are the categories $\SS$ that define an order on $\SS_0$.
The map \unsure{is this right?}
\[
  (\CC,F)
  \longmapsto (\CC,(\FF,\eta,\widetilde{\Omega})F),
\]
where $(\CC,F)$ is an ordered species of structures, is a bijection from the class of ordered species of structures to the class of species of morphisms $(\CC,\widehat{F})$ such that
\[
  \widehat{F}(\alpha(\widehat{F}))
  \subset \widehat{\Omega}
  \subset \FF.
\]



\subsection{Reminder on categories of homomorphisms}
\label{section:i.4}

\begin{rmenv}{Definition 6}
\label{definition:i-6}
  Let $\CC$ and $\HH$ be two categories;
  we say \cite{3a} that $(\CC,p,\HH,\SS)$ is a \emph{category of homomorphisms} if the following conditions are satisfied:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[\normalfont(1)]
      $(\CC,p,\HH)$ is a functor;
    \item[\normalfont(2)]
      \oldpage{357}
      $\SS$ is a subcategory of $\HH$ that contains $\HH_0$;
    \item[\normalfont(3)]
      $(\CC,p',\SS)$ is a species of structures, where $p'$ denotes the restriction of $p$ to $\SS$;
    \item[\normalfont(4)]
      If $h,h'\in\HH$, then the relations
      \[
        \begin{aligned}
          \alpha(h)
          &= \alpha(h'),
        \\\beta(h)
          &= \beta(h'),
        \\p(h)
          &= p(h'),
        \end{aligned}
      \]
      imply that $h=h'$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{rmenv}

\todo{spacing at the end of the enum inside the rmenv above as well}

Let $(\CC,p,\HH,\SS)$ be a category of homomorphisms.
An element $h\in\HH$ can be identified, by condition~(4) of \hyperref[definition:i-6]{Definition~6}, with a triple $(S',f,S)$, where
\[
  \begin{aligned}
    S
    &= \alpha(h) \in\HH_0,
  \\S'
    &= \beta(h) \in\HH_0,
  \\f
    &= p(h)\in\CC.
  \end{aligned}
\]
We usually represent an element of $\HH$ by such a triplet.
Note that we thus identify $\HH$ with a subcategory of the induced category $p_0^*(\CC)$ whose elements are the triples $(S',f,S)$ such that $S,S'\in\HH_0$, $f\in\CC$, and
\[
  \alpha(f)=p(S)
  \quad\text{and}\quad
  \beta(f)=p(S').
\]
Since an element of $\SS$ is entirely determined by the data of $\alpha(h)$ and $p(h)$, we write such elements either in the form $(\beta(h),p(h),\alpha(h))$ or in the form $(p(h),\alpha(h))$.
If $\SS$ is the groupoid of invertible elements of $\HH$, then $\HH$ is a species of structures over $\SS\times\SS$ with the composition law
\[
  \begin{gathered}
    \big((\bar{f}',\bar{f}),h\big)
    \longmapsto\bar{f}'\bullet h\bullet\bar{f}^{-1}
    \qquad\text{if and only if}
  \\\alpha(\bar{f})=\alpha(h)
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    \alpha(\bar{f}')=\beta(h)
  \end{gathered}
\]
where $h\in\HH$ and $\bar{f},\bar{f}'\in\SS$.

Let $(\CC,p,\HH,\SS)$ be a category of homomorphisms;
let $\SS_\gamma$ and $\CC_\gamma$ be the groupoids of invertible elements of $\SS$ and $\CC$ (respectively).
If $p(\SS_\gamma)$ is a saturated \cite{3a} subgroupoid of $\CC$, i.e. if
\[
  \big[f\in\CC_\gamma
  \quad\text{and}\quad
  \alpha(f)\in p(\SS_\gamma)\big]
  \implies
  f\in p(\SS_\gamma),
\]
then we say that $\HH$ is \emph{saturated over $\CC$}.

\begin{longcomm}{29.2}
  \emph{Enlargement Theorem.}

  $(\CC,p,\HH,\SS)$ is a category of homomorphisms if and only if $p\colon\HH\to\CC$ is a faithful (condition~(3)) functor (condition~(1)) whose restriction $\SS\to p(\SS)$ is (condition~(2)) a discrete opfibration.

  We say that a functor is \emph{amnestic} if any isomorphism that is sent to an identity is itself an identity, i.e. if its restriction to isomorphisms is well-faithful in the sense of \cite{coll77,coll122}.
  Then $\HH$ is saturated over $\CC$ if $p$ is a faithful amnestic functor that creates isomorphisms.

  If $\HH$ is a category of homomorphisms with $\SS$ the groupoid of isomorphisms of $\HH$, then $\HH$ is equivalent to a saturated category of homomorphisms.
  Indeed, more generally:

  \begin{itenv}{Theorem}
    Let $p\colon\HH\to\CC$ be any functor.
    Then there exists a smallest isomorphism-creating functor $q\colon\widetilde{\HH}\to\CC$ extending $p$, and $\HH$ is equivalent to $\widetilde{\HH}$.
  \end{itenv}

  We call such $q$ the (maximal) \emph{enlargement of $p$}.
  It is constructed as follows.
  Let $\mathcal{L}$ be the category given by the quadruples $(k,f',f,h)$, with $h\in\HH$, $f$ and $f'$ isomorphisms in $\CC$, and $k\bullet f=f'\bullet p(h)$ in $\CC$; composition is given by
  \[
    \begin{gathered}
      (k',f'',\hat{f},h')(k,f',f,h)
      = (k'\bullet k, f'', f, h'\bullet h)
    \\\text{if and only if}\quad
      \big[f'=\hat{f}
      \quad\text{and}\quad
      \alpha(h')=\beta(h)\big].
    \end{gathered}
  \]
  \[
    \begin{tikzcd}[sep=huge]
      {}
      &{} \ar[l,swap,"f''"]
    \\{} \ar[u,"k'"]
      &{} \ar[l,swap,"f'"] \ar[u,swap,"p(h')"]
    \\{} \ar[u,"k"]
      &{} \ar[l,"f"] \ar[u,swap,"p(h)"]
    \end{tikzcd}
    \qquad
    \begin{tikzcd}[sep=huge]
      {}
    \\{} \ar[u,swap,"h'"]
    \\{} \ar[u,swap,"h"]
    \end{tikzcd}
  \]
  (This subcategory of the comma category $\CC\downarrow p$ is used in \cite[Section~1]{coll100}).
  Then $\widetilde{\HH}$ is the strict quotient of $\mathcal{L}$ by the equivalence
  \[
    \begin{gathered}
      (k,f',f,h)
      \sim \big(
        k, f'\bullet p(g'), f\bullet p(g), {g'}^{-1}\bullet h\bullet g
      \big)
    \\\text{for any isomorphisms $g,g'\in\HH$ such that ${g'}^{-1}\bullet h\bullet g$ exists.}
    \end{gathered}
  \]
  Then $q$ sends $(k,f',f,h)$ to $k$, and the embedding
  \[
    (h\colon s\to s')
    \mapsto \big(
      p(h), p(s'), p(s), h
    \big)
  \]
  identifies $\HH$ with a subcategory of $\widetilde{\HH}$ that is equivalent to $\widetilde{\HH}$.

  Furthermore, $q$ is faithful (resp. amnestic) whenever $p$ is, whence the enlargement theorems for species of structures over groupoids and for categories of homomorphisms already obtained in \cite{coll47}.
  In fact, $p$ may be replaced by $q$ whenever categorical properties (i.e. those preserved by isomorphisms) are considered: the constructions are made in $\widetilde{\HH}$, and then transported by isomorphism in $\HH$.

  The above construction is generalised in \cite{coll77,coll122} to obtain extension theorems for functors.
  It is ``internalised'' in \cite{coll89,coll90,coll95,coll96}, giving an ``internal version'' of the Kan extension Theorem (see Comment 25.1).

In particular, let $(\MM,p,\HH,\SS)$ be a category of homomorphisms such that $\MM$ is the category defined in \hyperref[section:i.2]{§I.2}.\comm{29.3}{If $(\MM,p,\HH,\SS)$ is a category of homomorphisms with $\SS$ the groupoid of all isomorphisms of $\HH$, then $\HH$ is also called a \emph{concrete category}, and $p\colon\HH\to\MM$ a \emph{concrete functor} (and we'll often use these terms). In fact, some authors define a concrete functor as any set-valued amnestic faithful functor (without any ``transport of structures'' property); most of the following results remain valid in this case.}
Let $h\in\HH$;
the element $p(h)$ is, by definition, a map $(p(\beta(h)),g,p(\alpha(h)))$, where $g$ is a surjection.
Since the data of $\alpha(h)$, $\beta(h)$, and $g$ all together entirely determine $p(h)$, we simply represent $h$ by the triple $(\beta(h),g,\alpha(h))$ instead of by $(\beta(h),p(h),\alpha(h))$.
If $h$ is such that
\[
  p(\alpha(h))
  \subset p(\beta(h))
\]
and if $p(h)$ is the canonical injection from $p(\alpha(h))$ to $p(\beta(h))$, then we write $h$ as $(\beta(h),\iota,\alpha(h))$, i.e. $\iota$ denotes the identity map on $p(\alpha(h))$.

\subsection{Substructures}
\label{section:i.5}

Let $(\CC,p,\HH,\SS)$ be a category of homomorphisms such that $\SS$ contains the groupoid $\Gamma$ of invertible elements of $\HH$.

On $\HH_0$, consider the relation $\relrho$
\[
  s\relrho s'
  \quad\text{if and only if}\quad
  (s',p(s),s)\in\HH.
\]
This relation evidently implies that $p(s)=p(s')$.

\begin{itenv}{Proposition 2}
\label{proposition:i-2}
  The relation $\relrho$ is an order relation on $\HH_0$, and $(\CC,p,\Gamma)$ is the species of structure under $(\CC,F)$ such that\comm{30.1}{To be precise, one should read $p\iota$ instead of $p$ here. Indeed, in several instances, the restriction of a functor is denoted by the same letter as the functor itself; when the source and target are clearly indicated, this does not lead to any confusion, and so we shall not always mention it.}
  \[
    F(e)
    = (p^{-1}(e),\relrho_e)
    \qquad\text{for all $e\in\alpha(F)_0$}
  \]
  where $\relrho_e$ is the order relation induced by $\relrho$ on $p^{-1}(e)$.
\end{itenv}

\begin{proof}
  If $s\relrho s'$ and $s'\relrho s''$ then
  \[
    (s'',p(s'),s')\bullet(s',p(s),s)
    = (s'',p(s),s)
    \in\HH
  \]
  whence $s\relrho s''$.
  Suppose that $s\relrho s'$ and $s'\relrho s$;
  then
  \[
    (s,p(s'),s')\bullet(s',p(s),s)
    = (s,p(s),s)
    = s
  \]
  and
  \[
    (s',p(s),s)\bullet(s,p(s'),s')
    = s'
  \]
  thus
  \[
    (s',p(s),s)\in\Gamma.
  \]
  \oldpage{359}
  Since $(\CC,p,\Gamma)$ is a species of structures, from the equalities
  \[
    \alpha(s',p(s),s)=s
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    p(s',p(s),s)=p(s)
  \]
  we deduce that $(s',p(s),s)=s$;
  thus $s'=s$ and $\relrho$ is an order relation;
  the category of pairs that defines $\relrho$ can be identified with the subcategory $\HH_{\relrho}$ consisting of elements $(s',p(s),s)$ by identifying $(s',s)$ with $(s',p(s),s)$.
  If $(s',p(s),s)\in\HH_{\relrho}$ and $f\in p(\Gamma)$, then the equality
  \[
    \alpha(f)=p(s)
  \]
  guarantees the existence of $(\bar{s},f,s),(\bar{s}',f,s')\in\Gamma$;
  then
  \[
    (\bar{s}',f,s')\bullet(s',p(s),s)\bullet(s,f^{-1},\bar{s})
    = (\bar{s}',f\bullet p(s)\bullet f^{-1},\bar{s})
    = (\bar{s}',p(\bar{s}),\bar{s})
    \in\HH.
  \]
  Consequently, $p(\Gamma)$ acts on $\HH_{\relrho}$, with the composition law
  \[
    (f,(s',p(s),s))
    \longmapsto (\bar{s}',p(\bar{s}),\bar{s})
    \quad\text{if and only if}\quad
    \alpha(f)=p(s).
  \]
  Then $(p(\Gamma),p,\HH_{\relrho})$ is the species of structures under a species of morphisms, and the proposition follows from the end of \hyperref[section:i.2]{§I.2}.
\end{proof}

From now on, suppose that $\CC$ is an inductive category (in the sense of \hyperref[section:ii.6]{§II.6}, which is slightly more general than that of \cite{3c}).
If $g,f\in\CC$, then their pseudo-product in $\CC$, which is always defined (cf. \hyperref[section:ii]{§II}, \hyperref[proposition:i-22][Proposition~22]), is denoted by $gf$.

\begin{longcomm}{31.1}
  Up to (but not including) \hyperref[definition:i-9]{Definition~9}, the text remains valid without any modification \emph{if the hypothesis that $\CC$ is inductive is replaced by the hypothesis that $\CC$ is a sub-inductive category} (cf. \cite{coll69}), since all the pseudo-products used here still exist.
  This remark is important: some results will be applied to the category $\FF$ of categories, which is sub-inductive for the order ``is a subcategory of'', but not inductive (two subcategories of a category admit a meet, while two categories may not admit a larger common subcategory).
\end{longcomm}

Consider on $\HH_0$ the relation
\[
  \begin{gathered}
    s\relrhobar S
    \quad\text{if and only if}\quad
  \\\big[p(s)<p(S)
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    (S,p(S)p(s),s)\in\HH\big];
  \end{gathered}
\]
the relations induced by $\relrhobar$ and $\relrho$ on $p^{-1}(e)$ are identical, for all $e\in p(\HH_0)$.
The relation $p(s)<p(S)$ implies that
\[
  \alpha(p(S)p(s))
  = p(s);
\]
if, further, $(S,p(S)p(s),s)\in\HH$, then we also have that
\[
  \beta(p(S)p(s))
  = p(S).
\]

\begin{itenv}{Proposition 3}
\label{proposition:i-3}
  The relation $\relrhobar$ is an order relation on $\HH_0$;
  if $s\relrhobar S$, then $s$ is a sub-object \cite{5} of $S$ in $\HH$.
\end{itenv}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose that $s\relrhobar S$.
  If, further, $S\relrhobar s$, then
  \[
    p(S)=p(s)
  \]
  whence $s\relrho S$ and $S\relrho s$, i.e. $s=S$, by \hyperref[Proposition~2]{Proposition~2}.
  Suppose that $s'\relrhobar s$;
  from the relations
  \[
    \begin{gathered}
      k = (p(S)p(s))\bullet(p(s)p(s'))
      < p(S)p(s'),
    \\\alpha(k)=p(s')
      \quad\text{and}\quad
      \beta(k)=p(S),
    \end{gathered}
  \]
  it follows that
  \[
    k=p(S)p(s')
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    (S,p(S)p(s'),s')\in\HH
  \]
  thus $s'\relrhobar S$.
  \oldpage{360}
  Let $\bar{g}=(s,g,S')$ and $\bar{g}'=(s,g',S')$ be such that
  \[
    (S,p(S)p(s),s)\bullet\bar{g}
    = (S,p(S),p(s),s)\bullet\bar{g}'.
  \]
  From the relations
  \[
    \begin{gathered}
      (p(S)p(s))\bullet g = (p(S)p(s))\bullet g',
    \\g < (p(S)p(s))\bullet g
      \quad\text{and}\quad
      g' < (p(S)p(s))\bullet g',
    \\\alpha(g)=\alpha(g')
      \quad\text{and}\quad
      \beta(g)=\beta(g'),
    \end{gathered}
  \]
  we deduce that $g=g'$.
  Thus $\bar{g}=\bar{g}'$, which implies that $s$ is a sub-object of $S$ in $\HH$.
\end{proof}

The notion of \emph{substructure} that we will now define makes precise the notion of sub-object of a category.

\begin{rmenv}{Definition 7}
\label{definition:i-7}
  Let $S\in\HH_0$;
  we say that $s\in\HH_0$ is a \emph{substructure of $S$ in $(\CC,p,\HH,\SS)$}, and we write $s\subs_p S$, if the following conditions are satisfied:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[\normalfont(1)]
      $p(s)<p(S)$ and $(S,p(S)p(s),s)\in\HH$;
    \item[\normalfont(2)]
      If $(S,g,S')\in\HH$ is such that
      \[
        \alpha(p(s)g)=\alpha(g)
        \quad\text{and}\quad
        \beta(p(s)g)=p(s)
      \]
      then
      \[
        (s,p(s)g,S')\in\HH.
      \]
  \end{enumerate}
  If $s\subs_pS$, then we also write
  \[
    (S,p(S)p(s),s)
    = S\sups_p s
  \]
  and we say that $S\sups_p s$ is a \emph{$p$-injection}.
  We write $H_{\subs_p}$ to mean the class of $p$-injections.
\end{rmenv}

If there is no risk of confusion, then we simply say that $s$ is a substructure of $S$ in $\HH$, and we write $s\subs S$ and $S\sups s$ instead of $s\subs_p S$ and $S\sups_p s$ (respectively).

\begin{longcomm}{32.1}
  Substructures (in the definition of which $\SS$ is not used) were introduced for obtaining a good definition of structured categories.
  Most of the following propositions were devised for use in \hyperref[section:ii]{Part~II}.

  This definition seems to depend on the order of $\CC$.
  In fact, \hyperref[proposition:i-4]{Proposition~4} suggested a more general notion of a $(\CC',p)$-injection (\cite{coll69,coll66}), free from any use of an order on $\CC$.
  The $p$-injections defined here are exactly the $(\CC',p)$-injections in the case where
  \[
    \CC'
    = \{Ee \mid e<E\text{ in }\CC_0\}.
  \]
  Almost all of the results of this part (\hyperref[section:i]{Part I}) generalise to this setting; cf. \cite{coll66} and \cite{coll69}, where both notions are compared.

  \todo
\end{longcomm}

\begin{itenv}{Proposition 4}
\label{proposition:i-4}
  Let $s,S\in\HH_0$;
  then $s\subs_p S$ if and only if the following conditions are satisfied:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[\normalfont(1\textquotesingle)]
      $s\relrhobar S$ in $(\CC,p,\HH,\SS)$;
    \item[\normalfont(2\textquotesingle)]
      If $(S,(p(S)p(s))\bullet g',S')\in\HH$ then $(s,g',S')\in\HH$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itenv}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose that $s\subs_p S$;
  condition~(1) of \hyperref[definition:i-7]{Definition~7} implies that $s\relrhobar S$ in $(\CC,p,\HH,\SS)$.
  Let
  \[
    (S,p(S)p(s)\bullet g',S')\in\HH.
  \]
  We will show that the elements $g'$ and $g'_1=p(s)(p(S)p(s)\bullet g')$ are equal.
  We have that $p(s)<p(S)p(s)$, so
  \[
    g'
    = p(s)\bullet g'
    < (p(S)p(s))g'
  \]
  whence
  \[
    g'
    = p(s)\bullet g'
    < p(s)(p(S)p(s)g');
  \]
  \oldpage{361}
  but also
  \[
    \alpha(g'_1)<\alpha(g')
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    \beta(g'_1)<p(s)=\beta(g')
  \]
  whence
  \[
    \begin{aligned}
      \alpha(g'_1)
      &= \alpha(g')
      = p(S'),
    \\\beta(g'_1)
      &= \beta(g')
      = p(s).
    \end{aligned}
  \]
  Since $(\CC,<)$ is an inductive category, the relations
  \[
    \begin{aligned}
      g'
      &< g'_1,
    \\\alpha(g')
      &= \alpha(g'_1),
    \\\beta(g')
      &= \beta(g'_1),
    \end{aligned}
  \]
  imply that $g'=g'_1$.
  It then follows from condition~(2) of \hyperref[definition:i-7]{Definition~7 }that $(s,g',S')\in\HH$, and so condition~(2\textquotesingle) is satisfied.
  Conversely, suppose that conditions~(1\textquotesingle) and (2\textquotesingle) are satisfied;
  let $(S,g,S')\in\HH$ be such that
  \[
    \alpha(p(s)g)=\alpha(g)
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    \beta(p(s)g)=p(s).
  \]
  By using the relations
  \[
    \begin{gathered}
      (p(S)p(s))\bullet(p(s)g)<g,
    \\\alpha\big((p(S)p(s))\bullet(p(s)g)\big)=\alpha(g),
    \\\beta(g)=\beta\big((p(S)p(s))\bullet(p(s)g)\big)=p(S)
    \end{gathered}
  \]
  we see that $g=(p(S)p(s))\bullet(p(s)g)$.
  From condition~(2\textquotesingle) we thus deduce that
  \[
    (s,p(s)g,S')\in\HH
  \]
  i.e. $s\subs_p S$.

  \]
  together imply that
  \[
    s'\subs_p s
    \quad\text{(resp. $s'\relrhobar s$)}.
  \]
\end{itenv}

\begin{proof}
  Since $\relrhobar$ is an order relation, if $s\subs S$ and $S\subs s$, then $s=S$.
  Suppose that $s_1\subs s$ and $s\subs S$;
  then $s_1\relrhobar S$.
  We will show that the pair $(S,s_1)$ satisfies condition (2\textquotesingle) of \hyperref[proposition:i-4]{Proposition~4}.
  Let
  \[
    \bar{g}
    = (S,p(S)p(s_1)\bullet g',S')
    \in\HH.
  \]
  The elements $p(S)p(s_1)$ and $(p(S)p(s))\bullet(p(s)p(s_1))$ are equal, since they are both bounded above by $p(S)$ and have the same source and same target ($p(s_1)$ and $p(S)$, respectively);
  thus
  \[
    \bar{g}
    = \big(S,(p(S)p(s))\bullet(p(s)p(s_1)\bullet g'),S'\big)
    \in\HH
  \]
  and, since $s\subs S$,
  \[
    \bar{g}'
    = (s,(p(s)p(s_1))\bullet g', S')
    \in\HH;
  \]
  since $s_1\subs s$, it thus follows that
  \[
    (s_1,g',S')
    \in\HH
  \]
  i.e. $s_1\subs S$.
  Suppose that $s\subs S$, $s'\relrhobar S$, and $p(s')\subs p(s)$ in $(\CC,\Id_\CC,\CC,\CC)$.
  Then
  \[
    j
    = (S,p(S)p(s'),s')
    \in\HH;
  \]
  from the relations
  \[
    p(s') < p(s)
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    \beta(p(s)p(s')) = p(s)
  \]
  we deduce that the elements $p(S)p(s')$ and $(p(S)p(s))\bullet(p(s)p(s'))$ are equal, since they are both bounded above by $p(S)$ and have the same source and same target ($p(s')$ and $p(S)$, respectively).
  Consequently,
  \[
    j
    = \big(S,(p(S)p(s))\bullet(p(s)p(s')),s'\big)
  \]
  and, by Proposition~4,
  \[
    (s,p(s)p(s'),s')
    \in\HH
  \]
  whence $s'\relrhobar s$.
  Suppose further that $s'\subs S$;
  let
  \[
    \bar{g}'
    = (s,p(s)p(s')\bullet g',S')
    \in\HH.
  \]
  We see that
  \[
    \begin{aligned}
      \bar{g}
      &= (S,p(S)p(s),s)\bullet\bar{g}'
    \\&= \big(S,(p(S)p(s))\bullet(p(s)p(s'))\bullet g',S'\big)

    \in\HH.

  In $\HH$, the relation $\bar{h}'\subs\bar{h}$ is an order relation that satisfies the following conditions:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[\normalfont(1)]
      If $\bar{h}'\subs\bar{h}$, and $\alpha(\bar{h}')=\alpha(\bar{h})$ and $\beta(\bar{h}')=\beta(\bar{h})$, then $\bar{h}=\bar{h}'$;
    \item[\normalfont(2)]
      If $\bar{h}'\subs\bar{h}$ then $p(\bar{h}')\subs p(\bar{h})$ in $(\CC,\Id_\CC,\CC,\CC)$;
      if, further, $p(\bar{h})=p(\bar{h}')$, then $\bar{h}=\bar{h}'$;
    \item[\normalfont(3)]
      If $(\bar{h}_1,\bar{h}),(\bar{h}'_1,\bar{h}')\in\HH\star\HH$ and $\bar{h}'\subs\bar{h}$ and $\bar{h}'_1\subs\bar{h}_1$, then $\bar{h}'_1\bullet\bar{h}'\subs\bar{h}_1\bullet\bar{h}$;
    \item[\normalfont(4)]
      If $\bar{h}'\subs_p\bar{h}$, $\bar{h}''\subs_p\bar{h}$, and $p(\bar{h}'')\subs p(\bar{h}')$ in $(\CC,\Id_\CC,\CC,\CC)$, then $\bar{h}''\subs_p\bar{h}'$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itenv}

\begin{proof}
  Conditions~(1) and (3) imply that $(\HH,\subs)$ is an ordered category (see \hyperref[section:ii]{§II}, \hyperref[definition:i-18]{Definition~18}).
  Condition~(2) implies that $p$ belongs to $\widetilde{\Omega}'$ (see \hyperref[section:ii.6]{§II.6}), i.e. (§IV) that $(\HH,\subs)$ is an ordered category over $(\CC,<)$.\comm{35.1}{Charles never published §IV, but the results that he intended to put in it are scattered across several papers, e.g. ordered categories over an ordered category are considered in \cite{coll75}.}
\end{proof}

\begin{longcomm}{35.2}
  The following corollary is not correct: $(\HH,\subs)$ is a sub-inductive category, but not an inductive category.
  Indeed, a family of objects bounded by $s$ and $s'$ may have two different joins in the set of elements lesser than both $s$ and $s'$.
\end{longcomm}

\begin{itenv}{Corollary}
  If $\CC$ is \unsure{completely right regular}, and if, for all $s\in\HH_0$, the class of elements $p(s')$, where $s'\subs_p s$, is an inductive subclass of $\CC_0$, then $(\HH,\subs)$ is an inductive category over $(\CC,<)$.
\end{itenv}

\begin{itenv}{Proposition}
  Suppose that $\bar{h},\bar{h}'\in\Gamma$, $\alpha(\bar{h}')\subs_p\alpha(\bar{h})$, and $(p(\bar{h}')<p(\bar{h})$;
  then also $\beta(\bar{h}')\subs_p\beta(\bar{h})$, and, consequently, $\bar{h}'\subs_p\bar{h}$.
\end{itenv}

\begin{proof}
  \oldpage{364}
  Let
  \[
    \begin{aligned}
      \bar{h}
      &= (S_1,h,S)\in\Gamma
    \\\bar{h}'
      &= (s_1,h',s)\in\Gamma
    \end{aligned}
  \]
  be such that $h'<h$ and $j=(S,p(S)p(s),s)\in\HH$;
  then
  \[
    \begin{gathered}
      p\big(\bar{h}\bullet j\bullet \bar{h}'^{-1}\big)
      = h\bullet(p(S)p(s))\bullet h'^{-1}
      < p(S_1)p(s_1),
    \\\alpha\big(p\big(\bar{h}\bullet j\bullet\bar{h}'^{-1}\big)\big)
      = p(s_1)
      \quad\text{and}\quad
      \beta\big(p\big(\bar{h}\bullet j\bullet\bar{h}'^{-1}\big)\big)
      = p(S_1)
    \end{gathered}
  \]
  \begin{longcomm}{36.1}
    The above inequality (as well as several following ones) relies on the assertion $[h'<h\implies {h'}^{-1}<h^{-1}]$, which has to be proved.

    Suppose that $h'<h$, where $h\colon E\to\hat{E}$ and $h'\colon e\to\hat{e}$.
    Then there exists a pseudo-product $h^{-1}\hat{e}=h^{-1}\bullet(\hat{E}\hat{e})\colon\hat{e}\to E$;
    since
    \[
      (h^{-1}\hat{e})\bullet h'\colon e\to E
      \quad\text{and}\quad
      (h^{-1}\hat{e})\bullet h'
      < (h^{-1}\hat{e})h
      < h^{-1}h
      = E,
    \]
    we have that $(h^{-1}\hat{e})\bullet h'=eE$.
    It thus follows that
    \[
      {h'}^{-1}\bullet h'
      = e
      < eE
      = (h^{-1}\hat{e})\bullet h'
    \]
    and, composing with ${h'}^{-1}$, we see that
    \[
      {h'}^{-1}
      < h^{-1}\hat{e}
      < h^{-1}
    \]
    as desired.
  \end{longcomm}
  whence
  \[
    p\big(\bar{h}\bullet j\bullet\bar{h}'^{-1}\big)
    = p(S_1)p(s_1)
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    (S_1,p(S_1)p(s_1),s_1)
    \in\HH.
  \]
  Suppose, further, that $s\subs S$;
  let
  \[
    \bar{g}
    = (S_1,(p(S_1)p(s_1))\bullet g',S')
    \in\HH.
  \]
  The elements $h^{-1}\bullet(p(S_1)p(s_1))$ and $(p(S)p(s))\bullet h'^{-1}$ are equal, since they are both bounded above by $h^{-1}$ and have the same source and same target ($p(s_1)$ and $p(S)$, respectively).
  Thus
  \[
    \bar{h}^{-1}\bullet\bar{g}
    = \big(S,(p(S)p(s))\bullet\big( h'^{-1}\bullet g'\big),S'\big)
    \in\HH
  \]
  and it follows from Proposition~4 that
  \[
    \bar{g}'
    = (s,h'^{-1}\bullet g',S')
    \in\HH;
  \]
  consequently,
  \[
    \bar{h}'\bullet\bar{g}'
    = (s_1,g',S')
    \in\HH
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    s_1\subs S_1.
    \qedhere
  \]
\end{proof}

\begin{itenv}{Proposition 7}
\label{proposition:i-7}
  Let
  \[
    \bar{h}
    = (s_1,h,s)
    \in\HH
  \]
  such that $s'\subs_p s$ and $s'_1\subs_p s_1$.
  If there exists $h'\in\CC$ such that
  \[
    \begin{gathered}
      h'<h,
    \\\alpha(h')=p(s')
      \quad\text{and}\quad
      \beta(h')=p(s'_1)
    \end{gathered}
  \]
  then
  \[
    \bar{h}'
    =(s'_1,h',s')
    \in\HH
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    \bar{h}'\subs_p\bar{h}.
  \]
  If, further, $\bar{h}$ and $h'$ are invertible, then $\bar{h}'\in\Gamma$.
\end{itenv}

\begin{proof}
  We have that
  \[
    \bar{h}\bullet(s\subs_p s')
    = (s_1,h\bullet(p(s)p(s')),s')
    \in\HH;
  \]
  the elements $h\bullet(p(s)p(s'))$ and $p(s_1)p(s'_1)\bullet h'$ are equal, since they are bounded above by $h$ and have the same source and same target ($p(s')$ and $p(s_1)$, respectively);
  thus
  \[
    \bar{h}\bullet(s\subs_p s')
    = (s_1,(p(s_1)p(s'_1))\bullet h',s')
    \in\HH
  \]
  and, by \hyperref[proposition:i-4]{Proposition~4}, we see that
  \[
    \bar{h}'
    = (s'_1,h',s')
    \in\HH.
  \]
  \oldpage{365}
  If, further, $\bar{h}\in\Gamma$ and $h'$ is invertible, then also $(s',h'^{-1},s'_1)\in\HH$, whence $\bar{h}'\in\Gamma$.
\end{proof}

Let $\vsq\CC$ be the longitudinal category of quartets of $\CC$ (see \hyperref[section:ii.5]{§II.5}), i.e. the class of quadruples $(g_1,f_1,f,g)\in\CC^4$ such that $g_1\bullet f=f_1\bullet g$, endowed with the multiplication
\[
  (g'_1,f'_1,f',g')\vmult(g_1,f_1,f,g)
  = (g'_1,f'_1\bullet f_1,f'\bullet f,g)
  \quad\text{if and only if}\quad
  g'=g_1.
\]

\begin{longcomm}{37.1}
  A quartet of $\CC$ is (less poetically) called a (\emph{commutative}) \emph{square}, and the longitudinal and lateral compositions are more geometrically called the \emph{horizontal} and \emph{vertical} compositions (following Gray).
  \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
      {}
      &{} \ar[l]
      &{} \ar[l]
    \\{} \ar[u]
      &{} \ar[l] \ar[u]
      &{} \ar[l] \ar[u]
    \end{tikzcd}
    \qquad
    \begin{tikzcd}
      {}
      & \ar[l]

      & \ar[l] \ar[u]
    \\{} \ar[u]
      & \ar[l] \ar[u]
    \end{tikzcd}
  \]

  The category $\vsq\CC$ is also called the \emph{category of arrows of $\CC$} (i.e. by the name of its objects), and denoted by $\mathsf{Fl}\CC$ or $\mathsf{Ar}\CC$.
\end{longcomm}

\begin{itenv}{Proposition 8}
\label{proposition:i-8}
  Let $h,h'\in\CC$, and let
  \[
    \begin{array}{ll}
      \alpha(h)
      = s,
      &\alpha(h')
      = s',
    \\\beta(h)
      = s_1,
      &\beta(h')
      = s'_1.
    \end{array}
  \]
  Then the following conditions are equivalent:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[\normalfont(1)]
      $h'\subs h$ in $(\CC,\Id_\CC,\CC,\CC)$;
    \item[\normalfont(2)]
      $h'<h$ in $\CC$, and $\beta(ss')=s$ and $\beta(s_1s'_1)=s_1$;
    \item[\normalfont(3)]
      $s'<s$, $s'_1<s_1$, and $(h,s_1s'_1,ss',h')\in\sq\CC$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itenv}

\begin{proof}
  Indeed, conditions~(1) and (2) are equivalent by the above.
  If (2) is satisfied, then the elements $h\bullet ss'$ and $s_1s'_1\bullet h'$ are equal, since they are both bounded above by $h$, and have the same source and same target ($s'$ and $s_1$, respectively);
  thus (3) is satisfied.
  If condition~(3) is satisfied, then
  \[
    s'\subs s
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    s'_1\subs s_1
  \]
  since $\beta(ss')=s$ and $\beta(s_1s'_1)=s_1$.
  Further,
  \[
    s'_1<s_1s'_1
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    ss'<s
  \]
  whence
  \[
    h'
    < s_1s'_1\bullet h'
    = h\bullet ss'
    < h.
    \qedhere
  \]
\end{proof}

If $h'\subs h$ in $(\CC,\Id_\CC,\CC,\CC)$, then we denote by $h\sqsubs h'$ the quartet
\[
  (h,\beta(h)\beta(h'),\alpha(h)\alpha(h'),h').
\]
The class $\UU$ of quartets $h\sqsubs h'$ is a subcategory of $\vsq\CC$.
Let $\UU'$ be the subcategory of $\UU$ given by the quartets $h\sqsubs h'$ such that $h'$ and $h$ are invertible.

Let $\vsq\HH$ be the longitudinal category of quartets of $\HH$, and $\sq p$ the functor
\[
  (g_1,f_1,f,g)
  \longmapsto (p(g_1),p(f_1),p(f),p(g))
\]
from $\vsq\HH$ to $\vsq\CC$.
Then $(\vsq\CC,\sq p,\vsq\HH,\bar{\Gamma}')$ is a category of homomorphisms, where $\bar{\Gamma}'$ is the groupoid of invertible elements of $\vsq\HH$.\comm{37.2}{This is easy to prove (cf. \cite[Chapter~II]{coll122}).}
For a quadruple $\bar{G}=(\bar{g}_1,\bar{f}_1,\bar{f},\bar{g})$ to belong to $\vsq\HH$, it is necessary and sufficient that
\[
  \begin{array}{ll}
    \alpha(\bar{f})=\alpha(\bar{g}),
    & \beta(\bar{f})=\alpha(\bar{g}_1),
  \\\alpha(\bar{f}_1)=\alpha(\bar{g}),
    & \beta(\bar{f}_1)=\alpha(\bar{g}_1)
  \end{array}
\]
and that $\sq p(\bar{G})$ is a quartet;
indeed, the elements $\bar{g}_1\cdot\bar{f}$ and $\bar{f}_1\cdot\bar{g}$ are then equal, since they have the same image under $p$, and have the same source and same target.

\oldpage{366}
Let $\bar{\UU}$ be the subcategory of $\vsq\HH$ consisting of the quartets
\[
  \bar{\rHH}
  = (\bar{h}, s_1\subs_p s'_1, s\subs_p s', \bar{h}')
\]
such that $s'\subs_p s$ and $s'_1\subs_p s_1$.
Let $\bar{\UU}'$ be the subcategory of $\UU$ consisting of the quartets in $\UU$ such that $\bar{h},\bar{h}'\in\Gamma$.

\begin{itenv}{Proposition 9}
\label{proposition:i-9}
  We have $\bar{h}'\subs\bar{h}$ in $(\CC,p,\HH,\SS)$ if and only if there exists
  \[
    \bar{\rHH}
    = \left(
      \bar{h},
      \beta(\bar{h})\subs_p\beta(\bar{h}'),
      \alpha(\bar{h})\subs_p\alpha(\bar{h}'),
      \bar{h}'
    \right) \in \UU;
  \]
  in this case, $\sq p(\bar{\rHH})\in\UU$.
\end{itenv}

\begin{proof}
  If $\bar{h}'\subs_p\bar{h}$, then
  \[
    \begin{gathered}
      p(\bar{h}')<p(\bar{h}),
    \\\alpha(\bar{h}')\subs_p\alpha(\bar{h})
      \quad\text{and}\quad
      \beta(\bar{h}')\subs_p\beta(\bar{h})
    \end{gathered}
  \]
  and thus $\sq p(\bar{\rHH}$ is a quartet and $\bar{\rHH}\in\bar{\UU}$.
  Conversely, if $\bar{\rHH}\in\bar{\UU}$, then we find that $\sq p(\bar{\rHH})\in\UU$ by condition~(3) of \hyperref[proposition:i-8]{Proposition~8};
  it thus follows that $p(\bar{h}')<p(\bar{h})$, and so $\bar{h}'\subs\bar{h}$ in $(\CC,p,\HH,\SS)$.
\end{proof}

If $\bar{h}'\subs\bar{h}$ in $(\CC,p,\HH,\SS)$, then the corresponding quartet $\bar{\rHH}$ will be denoted $\bar{h}\sqsubs\bar{h}'$.
In $\HH$ (resp. in $\CC$), we say that a triple $(g_1,f_1,f)$  is \emph{included in a quartet} if there exists a quartet $(g_1,f_1,f,g)$.
\hyperref[proposition:i-7]{Proposition~7} is equivalent to:

\begin{itenv}{Proposition 7~\emph{bis}}
\label{proposition:i-7bis}
  For a triplet
  \[
    \mathrm{T}
    = (\bar{h},s_1\subs_p s'_1, s\subs_p s'),
  \]
  where $\bar{h}\in\HH$, to be included in a quartet $\bar{\rHH}$, it is necessary and sufficient that
  \[
    s=\alpha(\bar{h})
    \quad\text{and}
    s_1=\beta(\bar{h})
  \]
  and that
  \[
    p^3(T)
    = \big(
      p(\bar{h}), p(s_1)p(s'_1), p(s)p(s')
    \big)
  \]
  be included in a quartet $\rHH$;
  in this case, we have that $\bar{\rHH}\in\bar{\UU}$ and $\rHH\in\UU$.
  If, further, $H\in\UU'$ and $\bar{h}\in\Gamma$, then $\bar{\rHH}\in\bar{\UU}'$.
\end{itenv}

If $\mathrm{T}=(\bar{h},s_1\subs_p s'_1,s\subs_p s')$ is included in a quartet, then the quartets $\bar{\rHH}$ and $\rHH$ in which $\mathrm{T}$ and $p^3(\mathrm{T})$ are included are unique;
consequently, we have that
\[
  \rHH = p(\bar{h})\sqsubs h'
  \quad\text{and}\quad
  \bar{\rHH} = \bar{h}\sqsubs_p \bar{h}',
\]
\oldpage{367}
where $h'$ and $\bar{h}'$ are determined by $\mathrm{T}$.
The element $\bar{h}'$ can be thought of as the composite of $\bar{h}$ with $(s'_1,s')$;
this composite will be denoted $\bar{h}\vdash_p(s'_1,s')$ and called the \emph{$p$-restriction} of $\bar{h}$ to $(s'_1,s')$.

Note that the composite $\bar{h}'$ is also determined by the data of the triple $(\bar{h},(p(s'_1),p(s')))$.

In particular,

\begin{itemize}
  \item if $s'_1=\beta(\bar{h})$ and $s'\subs\alpha(\bar{h})$, then there exists a $p$-restriction $\bar{h}\vdash_p(s'_1,s')$ and
    \[
      \bar{h}\vdash_p(s'_1,s')
      = \bar{h}\bullet(s\subs_p s')
    \]
  \item if $s'_1=\beta(\bar{h})$ and $s'=\alpha(\bar{h})$, then there exists a $p$-restriction $\bar{h}\vdash_p(s'_1,s')$ if and only if
    \[
      \begin{aligned}
        \alpha(p(s'_1)p(\bar{h}))
        &= p(s')
      \\\beta(p(s'_1)p(\bar{h}))
        &= p(s'_1).
      \end{aligned}
    \]
    In this case,
    \[
      \bar{h}\vdash_p(s'_1,s')
      = \big(
        s'_1, p(s'_1)p(\bar{h}), s'
      \big).
    \]
\end{itemize}

Let $\HH'$ be a subcategory of $\HH$ that contains $\HH_0$;
let $p'$ be the restriction of $p$ to $\HH'$.
Suppose that $(\CC,p',\HH',\HH'\cap\Gamma)$ is a category of homomorphisms.

\begin{itenv}{Proposition 10}
\label{proposition:i-10}
  The following conditions are equivalent:

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[\normalfont($\sigma$)] $s\subs_p S$ in $(\CC,p,\HH,\SS)$ implies that $s\subs_{p'}S$ in $(\CC,p',\HH',\HH'\cap\Gamma)$;

    \item[\normalfont($\sigma_1$)] $\HH'\vdash_p(\HH_0\times\HH_0)\in\HH'$, i.e. if $\bar{h}'\in\HH'$, then every $p$-restriction of $\bar{h}'$ belongs to $\HH'$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itenv}

\begin{proof}
  If ($\sigma$) is satisfied, then the category of $p'$-injections contains $\HH_{\subs_p}$, and ($\sigma_1$) is satisfied.
  Conversely, suppose that ($\sigma_1$) is satisfied, and let $s\subs S$ in $(\CC,p,\HH,\SS)$.
  The relations $S\in\HH'$ and $s\subs_p S$ imply that
  \[
    S\vdash_p(S,s)
    = \big(
      S,p(S)p(s),s
    \big) \in \HH'.
  \]
  Let $(S,p,S')\in\HH'$ be such that
  \[
    \alpha(p(s)g) = \alpha(g)
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    \beta(p(s)g) = p(s);
  \]
  then the composite $(S,g,S')\vdash_p(s,S')=(s,p(s)g,S')$, being defined, belongs to $\HH'$.
  Thus $s\subs_{p'}S$ in $(\CC,p',\HH',\HH'\cap\Gamma)$.
\end{proof}

We will later see (\hyperref[§II]{section:ii}, \hyperref[theorem:16]{Theorem~16}) that $\vsq\CC$ is an inductive category for the order relation
\[
  (g'_1,f'_1,f',g')
  < (g_1,f_1,f,g)
\]
\oldpage{368}
if and only if
\[
  \begin{array}{ll}
    g'<g,
    & g'_1<g_1,
  \\f'_1<f_1,
    & f'<f.
  \end{array}
\]
In the following theorem, we set
\[
  [\bar{h}]
  = (\bar{h},\beta(\bar{h}),\alpha(\bar{h}),\bar{h})
  \in (\vsq\HH)_0
\]
for all $\bar{h}\in\HH$, and
\[
  [h]
  = (h,\beta(h),\alpha(h),h)
  \in (\vsq\CC)_0
\]
for all $h\in\CC$.

\begin{itenv}{Theorem 2}
\label{theorem:2}
  The following conditions are equivalent:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[\normalfont(1)] $[\bar{h}']\subs_{\sq p}[\bar{h}]$ and $[\beta(\bar{h}')]\subs_{\sq p}[\beta(\bar{h})]$ in $(\vsq\CC,\sq p,\vsq\HH,\bar{\Gamma}')$;
    \item[\normalfont(2)] $\bar{h}'$ is a sub-homomorphism of $\bar{h}$ in $(\CC,p,\HH,\SS)$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itenv}

\begin{proof}
  Let
  \[
    \bar{h}=(s_1,h,s)\in\HH
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    \bar{h}'=(s'_1,h',s')\in\HH.
  \]
  Suppose that $\bar{h}'\subs_p\bar{h}$;
  by \hyperref[proposition:i-5]{Proposition~5}, it follows that $h'\subs h$ in $(\CC,\Id_\CC,\CC,\CC)$, whence
  \[
    \big(h,\beta(h)\beta(h'),\alpha(h)\alpha(h'),h'\big)\in\UU;
  \]
  furthermore, this quartet is the pseudo-product $[h][h']$ in $\vsq\CC$.
  Since the quadruple $(\bar{h},s_1\subs_p s'_1,s\subs_p s',\bar{h}')$ is a quartet of $\HH$ and admits $[h][h']$ as its image under $\sq p$, we thus deduce that $[\bar{h}']\relrhobar[\bar{h}]$ in $(\vsq\CC,\sq p,\vsq\HH,\bar{\Gamma}')$.
  Let $\bar{\mathrm{G}}=(\bar{h},\bar{f}_1,\bar{f},\bar{k})\in\sq\HH$ be such that
  \[
    \begin{aligned}
      \alpha\big(
        [p(\bar{h}')]\sq p(\bar{\mathrm{G}})
        \big)
        &= [p(\bar{k})]
    \\\beta\big(
        [p(\bar{h}')]\sq p(\bar{\mathrm{G}})
        \big)
        &= [p(\bar{h}')]
        = [h'];
    \end{aligned}
  \]
  then
  \[
    \begin{aligned}
      \sq p([\bar{h}'])
      &= [p(\bar{h}')]
    \\{}[p(\bar{h}')]\sq p(\bar{\mathrm{G}})
      &= \big(
        h', p(s'_1)p(\bar{f}_1), p(s')p(\bar{f}), p(\bar{k})
      \big),
    \end{aligned}
  \]
  whence
  \[
    \begin{aligned}
      \alpha\big(p(s')p(\bar{f})\big)
      &= \alpha(p(\bar{f}))
    \\\beta\big(p(s')p(\bar{f})\big)
      &= p(s').
    \end{aligned}
  \]
  It thus follows that
  \[
    \bar{f}'
    = \big(
      s', p(s')p(\bar{f}), \alpha(\bar{f})
    \big)
    \in\HH
  \]
  and, similarly,
  \[
    \bar{f}'_1
    = \big(
      s'_1, p(s'_1)p(\bar{f}_1), \alpha(\bar{f}_1)
    \big)
    \in\HH.
  \]
  Let $\bar{\mathrm{G}}'=(\bar{h}',\bar{f}'_1,\bar{f}',k)$;
  since the projection under $\sq p$ of $\bar{\mathrm{G}}'$ is the quartet $[p(\bar{h}')]\sq p(\bar{\mathrm{G}})$, we have that $\bar{\mathrm{G}}'\in\sq\HH$.
  Thus $[\bar{h}']\subs_{\sq p}[\bar{h}]$.
  Furthermore, $s'_1\subs_p s_1$ similarly implies that $[s'_1]\subs_{\sq p}[s_1]$, and so condition~(1) is satisfied.

  Conversely, suppose that $[\bar{h}']\subs[\bar{h}]$ in $(\vsq\CC,\sq p,\vsq\HH,\bar{\Gamma}')$.
  Then
  \[
    h'<h
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    [h][h'] = \big(
      h, \beta(h)\beta(h'), \alpha(h)\alpha(h'), h'
    \big)
  \]
  \oldpage{369}
  and we thus deduce that
  \[
    \big( s, p(s)p(s'), s' \big)\in\HH
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    \big( s_1, p(s_1)p(s'_1), s'_1 \big)\in\HH.
  \]
  Let
  \[
    \bar{g}
    = (s,g,S')\in\HH
  \]
  where $g=(p(s)p(s'))\bullet g'$.
  Then
  \[
    \bar{\mathrm{G}}
    = (\bar{h},\bar{h}\bullet\bar{g},\bar{g},S')
    \in\vsq\HH
  \]
  and
  \[
    \begin{aligned}
      \sq p(\bar{\mathrm{G}})
      &= (h,h\bullet g,g,p(S'))
    \\&= [h][h']\bullet(h',h'\bullet g',g',p(S'));
    \end{aligned}
  \]
  it thus follows that
  \[
    (\bar{h}',\bar{h}'\bullet\bar{g}',\bar{g}',S')\in\bar{\UU}
  \]
  i.e. that $\bar{g}'=(s',g',S')\in\HH$.
  This proves that $s'$ is a substructure of $s$ in $(\CC,p,\HH,\SS)$.
  If, further, $[s'_1]\subs_{\sq p}[s_1]$, then we similarly have that $s'_1\subs_p s_1$, and so $\bar{h}'\subs\bar{h}$ in $(\CC,p,\HH,\SS)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{itenv}{Corollary 1}
  Let $\bar{h},\bar{h}'\in\Gamma$.
  Then $\bar{h}'\subs_p\bar{h}$ if and only if $[\bar{h}']\subs_{\sq p}[\bar{h}]$.
\end{itenv}

\begin{proof}
  Indeed, if $[\bar{h}']\subs_{\sq p}[\bar{h}]$ then the proof of \hyperref[theorem:2]{Theorem~2} shows that we have $\alpha(\bar{h}')\subs_p\alpha(\bar{h})$, and it follows from \hyperref[proposition:i-6]{Proposition~6} that $\bar{h}'\subs_p\bar{h}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{itenv}{Corollary 2}
  $\bar{\UU}$ is a subcategory of the category of $\sq p$-injections.
\end{itenv}

\begin{rmenv}{Definition 9}
\label{definition:i-9}
  We say that $(\CC,p,\HH,\SS)$ is a \emph{right-solving category of homomorphisms} if the following axiom is satisfied:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[\normalfont(R)] Let $h,h'\in\HH$ be such that
      \[
        \alpha(h)=\alpha(h')
        \quad\text{and}\quad
        \beta(h)=\beta(h').
      \]
      Then there exists $s\subs_p\alpha(h)$ such that
      \[
        p(s)
        = \alpha\big(
          p(h)\cap p(h')
        \big).
      \]
      The substructure $s$ of $\alpha(h)$ is called the \emph{$p$-kernel} of $(h,h')$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{rmenv}

We similarly define the notion of a \emph{left-solving} category of homomorphisms $(\CC,p,\HH,\SS)$ by replacing $\alpha$ with $\beta$ in the definition above.

\begin{longcomm}{41.2}
  This definition, given for inductive $\CC$, is also valid as soon as any two parallel morphisms (i.e. morphisms with the same source and same target) have a meet in $\CC$;
  for instance, such is the case when $\CC$ is the category of categories (though this condition may not be satisfied in some sub-inductive categories).

  In usual cases (in particular, if $\CC$ is the category of sets), $p(s)$ is an equaliser of $(p(h),p(h'))$;
  then, since $p$ is faithful, $s$ is a $p$-kernel of $(h,h')$ if and only if it is an equaliser of $(h,h')$ in $\HH$ (cf. \cite[Proposition~3.1]{coll109});
  so axiom~(R) means that $p$ creates equalisers defined by meets (cf. Comment~221.2 on \cite{coll100}).
  This justifies the name ``$p$-kernel'' (an equaliser is also called a \emph{difference kernel}, or even just a \emph{kernel}).
\end{longcomm}

  \begin{enumerate}

      If, for all $S\in\HH_0$ and all $e<p(S)$, there exists $s\subs_p S$ such that $p(s)=e$, then $(\CC,p,\HH,\SS)$ is right and left solving.

\begin{itenv}{Proposition 11}
\label{proposition:i-11}
  If $(\CC,p,\HH,\SS)$ is a right-solving category of homomorphisms, and if $\beta(Ee)=E$ for all $e<E$ in $\CC_0$, then the conditions
  \[
    \begin{gathered}
      h,h'\in\HH,
    \\\alpha(h)=\alpha(h')
      \quad\text{and}\quad
      \beta(h)=\beta(h')
    \end{gathered}
  \]
  imply that
  \[
    h\vdash_p(\beta(h),s)
    = h'\vdash_p(\beta(h),s),
  \]
  where $s$ is the $p$-kernel of $(h,h')$.
\end{itenv}

\begin{proof}
  Set
  \[
    \begin{gathered}
      p(h)\cap p(h')=f,
    \\e=\beta(f)
      \quad\text{and}\quad
      E=\beta(p(h)).
    \end{gathered}
  \]
  Then
  \[
    Ee\bullet f<p(h)
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    Ee\bullet f<p(h')
  \]
  whence
  \[
    p(h)\cap p(h')
    = f
    < Ee\bullet f
    < p(h)\cap p(h').
  \]
  It thus follows that $f=Ee\bullet f$ and $E=e$.
  The elements $f$ and
  \[
    p(h)p(s)
    = p(h)p\big(
      \alpha(h)\sups_p s
    \big)
  \]
  are equal, since they are bounded above by $p(h)$ and have the same source and same target ($p(s)$ and $E$, respectively).
  Thus $f=p(h)p(s)$.
  Similarly, $f=p(h')p(s)$.
  Since
  \[
    h\vdash_p(\beta(h),s)
    = \big(
      \beta(h), p(h)p(s), s
    \big)
    = (\beta(h),f,s)
  \]
  and
  \[
    h'\vdash_p(\beta(h),s)
    = (\beta(h),f,s)
  \]
  we have that
  \[
    h\vdash_p(\beta(h),s)
    = h'\vdash_p(\beta(h),s).
  \]
\end{proof}

In what follows, we further suppose that $\HH$ is endowed with an order relation $<$ such that $(\HH,<)$ is an inductive category, and such that $p$ is a strict inductive map from $(\HH,<)$ to $(\CC,<)$, i.e. such that $(\HH,<)$ is an inductive category over $(\CC,<)$ with respect to $p$ (see \hyperref[section:iv]{§IV}).\comm{42.1}{This notion (of an inductive category over $(\CC,<)$ with respect to $p$) is considered in \cite{coll53}. The definition of a \emph{strict inductive map} is given in Part~II, Section~6.}

\begin{itenv}{Theorem 3}
\label{theorem:3}
  The following conditions are equivalent:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[\normalfont(c)]
      $(\CC,p,\HH,\SS)$ is right solved, and $h'\subs_p h$ in $(\CC,p,\HH,\SS)$ if and only if $h'<h$ in $\HH$.

    \item[\normalfont(c')]
      Let $s,s'\in\HH_0$;
      then $s'\subs_p s$ in $(\CC,p,\HH,\SS)$ if and only if $s'<s$ in $\HH$;
      in this case, $\beta(ss')=s$.
      Furthermore, the conditions
      \[
        \begin{gathered}
          h,h'\in\HH
        \\\alpha(h)=\alpha(h')
          \quad\text{and}\quad
          \beta(h)=\beta(h')
        \end{gathered}
      \]
      \oldpage{371}
      imply that
      \[
        p(h\cap h')
        = p(h)\cap p(h').
      \]
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itenv}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose that condition~(c) is satisfied;
  then
  \[
    s'\subs s\text{ in }(\CC,p,\HH,\SS)
    \quad\text{if and only if}\quad
    s'<s;
  \]
  in this case, $(s,p(s)p(s'),s')$ is a sub-homomorphism of $s$, and so
  \[
    \big(
      s, p(s)p(s'), s'
    \big)
    = s\sups_p s'
    = ss'
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    \beta(ss')=s.
  \]
  We thus deduce that the following conditions are equivalent:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[\normalfont(a)]
      $h'<h$ in $\HH$;
    \item[\normalfont(b)]
      $\alpha(h')<\alpha(h)$, $\beta(h')<\beta(h)$, and $p(h)<p(h')$;
    \item[\normalfont(c)]
      $h'\subs h$ in $(\HH,\Id_\HH,\HH,\HH)$.
  \end{enumerate}
  Let $h,h'\in\HH$ be such that
  \[
    \alpha(h) = \alpha(h')
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    \beta(h) = \beta(h');
  \]
  since the category of homomorphisms $(\HH,\Id_\HH,\HH,\HH)$ is right solved, and since $\alpha(h\cap h')$ is the $\Id_\HH$-kernel of $(h,h')$, we have that
  \[
    \beta(h\cap h')
    = \beta(h)
  \]
  by \hyperref[proposition:i-11]{Proposition~11};
  consequently, we also have that
  \[
    \beta(p(h)\cap p(h'))
    = p(\beta(h)).
  \]
  Let $s$ be the $p$-kernel of $(h,h')$;
  the elements $p(h)\cap p(h')$ and $p(h)p(s)$ are equal, since they are both bounded above by $p(h)$ and have the same source and same target ($p(s)$ and $\beta(p(h))$, respectively);
  similarly,
  \[
    p(h)\cap p(h')
    = p(h')p(s).
  \]
  Then
  \[
    \begin{aligned}
      h\vdash_p(\beta(h),s)
      &= \big(
        \beta(h), p(h)p(s), s
      \big)
    \\&= \big(
        \beta(h), p(h)\cap p(h'), s
      \big)
    \\&= h'\vdash_p(\beta(h),s)
    \end{aligned}
  \]
  and
  \[
    h\vdash_p(\beta(h),s)
    < h\cap h'.
  \]
  The relations
  \[
    \begin{gathered}
      p(\alpha(h\cap h'))
      = \alpha(p(h)\cap p(h'))
      = p(s),
    \\\alpha(h\cap h') < \alpha(h)
      \quad\text{and}\quad
      s < \alpha(h)
    \end{gathered}
  \]
  imply that\comm{43.1}{Since $p$ is strict, we have immediately that $s=\alpha(h\cap h')$.}
  \[
    \alpha(h\cap h')
    < s.
  \]
  Thus
  \[
    s = \alpha(h\cap h')
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    h\cap h' = h\vdash_p(\beta(h),s)
  \]
  and so
  \[
    p(h\cap h')
    = p(h)\cap p(h').
  \]

  \oldpage{372}
  Conversely, suppose that condition~(c') is satisfied;
  if $h'<h$ then
  \[
    \begin{gathered}
      p(h')<p(h),
    \\\alpha(h')\subs\alpha(h)
      \quad\text{and}\quad
      \beta(h')\subs\beta(h)
    \end{gathered}
  \]
  whence $h'\subs_p h$.
  Let $h$ and $h'$ be such that
  \[
    \alpha(h) = \alpha(h')
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    \beta(h) = \beta(h');
  \]
  since
  \[
    \alpha(h\cap h')
    < \alpha(h)
  \]
  and
  \[
    p(\alpha(h\cap h'))
    = \alpha(p(h\cap h'))
    = \alpha(p(h)\cap p(h')),
  \]
  the category of homomorphisms $(\CC,p,\HH,\SS)$ is right solved.
  Suppose that $h'\subs_p h$;
  set
  \[
    \begin{array}{ll}
      \alpha(h)
      = s,
      &\alpha(h')
      = s',
    \\\beta(h)
      = s_1,
      &\beta(h')
      = s'_1.
    \end{array}
  \]
  Since $s'\subs s$ and $s'_1\subs s_1$, the elements
  \[
    hs'=h\bullet ss'
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    s_1h'=s_1s'_1\bullet h'
  \]
  have the same source and same target ($s'$ and $s_1$, respectively).
  We will show that they are equal;
  indeed,
  \[
    p(hs')=p(h)\bullet p(ss')
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    p(s_1h')=p(s_1s'_1)\bullet p(h')
  \]
  are bounded above by $p(h)$, and have the same source and same target ($p(s')$ and $p(s_1)$, respectively), and so $p(h's)=p(s_1h')$.
  We thus deduce that $hs'=s_1h'$, whence
  \[
      h'
      = s'_1\bullet h < (s_1s'_1)\bullet h'
    = hs'
    < h.
  \]
  Thus condition~(c) is satisfied.
\end{proof}

\begin{rmenv}{Remark}
  \hyperref[theorem:3]{Theorem~3} still holds true (without any modifications to the proof) if we replace the hypothesis ``$(\HH,<)$ is an inductive category'' by the hypothesis ``$(\HH,<)$ is an ordered category in which any two elements have an intersection'' (\hyperref[section:ii.6]{§II.6}).\comm{44.1}{It suffices that \emph{any two parallel morphisms admit a meet} (this remark allows us to apply the result when $\CC$ is the category $\FF$).}
\end{rmenv}

\begin{rmenv}{Example}
  Let $(\CC,p,\HH,\SS)$ be a right-solved category of homomorphisms such that $\HH_0$ is an inductive class \cite{3a} for the relation $\subs$;
  if we endow $\HH$ with the relation $\subs$, then $\HH$ becomes an inductive category, and condition~(c) of \hyperref[theorem:3]{Theorem~3} is then satisfied.

  \begin{longcomm}{44.2}
    We have to suppose that either \emph{$\CC$ is completely right regular}, or that \emph{$p_0$ from $\HH_0$ to $\CC_0$ preserves joins}.

    Indeed, let $h_i\colon s_i\to s'_i$ be morphisms in $\HH$ such that $h_i<h$;
    then there exist joins $s=\bigcup s_i$ and $s'=\bigcup s'_i$ in $(\HH,\subs)$;
    the above hypothesis implies that, if $k$ is the pseudo-product $p(s')(p(h)p(s))$, then there exists a commutative square in $\CC$ of the form
    \[
      \begin{tikzcd}
        p(s')
          \ar[d,swap,"p(S')p(s')"]
        & p(s)
          \ar[l,swap,"k"]
          \ar[d,"p(S)p(s)"]
      \\p(S')
        & p(S)
          \ar[l,"p(h)"]
      \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    hence $h$ has a sub-morphism $h'\colon s\to s'$, and $h'=\bigcup h_i$.
  \end{longcomm}

  It is also the case for the categories of homomorphisms $(\MM,p_\FF,\FF,\FF_\gamma)$ and $(\MM,\theta_u,\widetilde{\TT}_u,\TT)$ when $\FF$ and $\widetilde{\TT}_u$ are endowed with their usual order relations.

  \begin{longcomm}{44.3}
    This assertion is not correct: $\FF$ satisfies condition~(c), but $(\FF_0,\subs)$ is not an inductive class; $\widetilde{\TT}_u$ is not right solving.
  \end{longcomm}

  However, $(\MM,\theta,\widetilde{\TT},\TT)$ does not satisfy condition~(c).
\end{rmenv}

Let $(\HH,\bar{p},\bar{\HH},\bar{\SS})$ be a category of homomorphisms such that $\bar{\SS}$ contains the groupoid $\bar{\Gamma}$ of invertible elements of $\bar{\HH}$, and such that $(\HH,\bar{p},\bar{\SS})$ is a species of superstructures \cite{3a} over $(\CC,p,\SS)$.
\oldpage{373}
These conditions imply that $(\CC,p\bar{p},\bar{\HH},\bar{\SS})$ is a category of homomorphisms.
An element $\bar{h}$ of $\bar{\HH}$ will be denoted either by the triple $(\beta(\bar{h}),\bar{p}(\bar{h}),\alpha(\bar{h}))$ or by the triple $(\beta(\bar{h}),p\bar{p}(\bar{h}),\alpha(\bar{h}))$.

Note that the conditions
\[
  s,S,\in\bar{\HH}_0
  \quad\text{and}\quad
  s\subs_{p\bar{p}} S
\]
imply that $\bar{p}(s)\relrhobar\bar{p}(S)$ in $(\CC,p,\HH,\SS)$, but, in general, they do not imply that $\bar{p}(s)\subs_p\bar{p}(S)$.

\begin{itenv}{Proposition 12}
\label{proposition:i-12}
  Let $s,S\in\bar{\HH}_0$.
  The conditions

      \beta\big(\bar{p}(S)\bar{p}(s)\big) = \bar{p}(S)
    \end{gathered}
  \]
  imply that $s\subs_{\bar{p}}S$.
\end{itenv}

\begin{proof}
  Let
  \[
    \bar{j}
    = \big(
      S, p\bar{p}(S)p\bar{p}(s), s
    \big) \in \bar{\HH};
  \]
  then
  \[
    p\bar{p}(\bar{j})
    = p\big(
      \bar{p}(S)\bar{p}(s)
    \big)
    = p\bar{p}(S)p\bar{p}(s),
  \]
  since
  \[
    \begin{gathered}
      p\big(

      \quad\text{and}\quad
      \beta\big(
        \bar{p}(S)\bar{p}(s)
      \big) = \bar{p}(S).
    \end{gathered}
  \]
  Thus
  \[
    \bar{p}(\bar{j})
    = \big(
      \bar{p}(S), p\bar{p}(S)p\bar{p}(s), \bar{p}(s)
    \big)
    = \bar{p}(S)\bar{p}(s)
  \]
  and
  \[
    \bar{j}
    =\big(
      S, \bar{p}(S)\bar{p}(s), s
    \big).
  \]
  Let
  \[
    \bar{g}
    = \big(
      S, \bar{p}(S)\bar{p}(s)\bullet g', S'
    \big) \in\bar{\HH}
  \]
  where $g'\in\HH$.
  We have that
  \[
    \begin{aligned}
      \bar{p}(\bar{g})
      &= \big(
        \bar{p}(S),
        p\big(\bar{p}(S)\bar{p}(s)\big)\bullet p(g'),
        \bar{p}(S')
      \big)
    \\&= \big(
        \bar{p}(S),
        \big(p\bar{p}(S)p\bar{p}(s)\big)\bullet p(g'),
        \bar{p}(S')
      \big)
    \end{aligned}
  \]
  whence
  \[
    \bar{g}
    = \big(
      S, p\bar{p}(S)p\bar{p}(s)\bullet p(g'), S'
    \big).
  \]
  From the condition that $s\subs_{\bar{p}}S$, and by \hyperref[proposition:i-4]{Proposition~4}, it follows that
  \[
    \bar{g}'
    = (s, p(g'), S')
    \in\bar{\HH}.
  \]
  Since $g'=(\bar{p}(s),p(g'),\bar{p}(S'))$, we thus deduce that
  \[
    \bar{p}(\bar{g}') = g'
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    \bar{g}' = (s,g',S') \in \bar{\HH}.
  \]
  Thus $s\subs_{\bar{p}}S$, by \hyperref[proposition:i-4]{Proposition~4}.

    \bar{p}(s) < \bar{p}(S)
  \]
  imply that $s\subs_{\bar{p}}S$.
\end{itenv}

\begin{proof}
  Indeed, from these conditions it follows that
  \[
    \begin{aligned}
      p\big(
        \bar(p)(S)\bar{p}(s)
      \big)
      &= p\bar{p}(S)p\bar{p}(s),
    \\\alpha\big(
        p\bar{p}(S)p\bar{p}(s)
      \big)
      &= p\bar{p}(s),
    \\\beta\big(
        p\bar{p}(S)p\bar{p}(s)
      \big)
      &= p\bar{p}(S),
    \end{aligned}
  \]
  whence
  \[
    \bar{p}(S)
    = \beta\big(
      \bar{p}(S)\bar{p}(s)
    \big)
  \]
  since
  \[
    \beta\big(
      \bar{p}(S)\bar{p}(s)
    \big) < \bar{p}(S)
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    p\big(
      \beta\big(
        \bar{p}(S)\bar{p}(s)
      \big)
    \big) = p\bar{p}(S).
  \]
  We are thus reduced to the hypotheses of \hyperref[proposition:i-12]{Proposition~12}.
\end{proof}

From now on, we will further suppose that the conditions
\[
  \begin{gathered}
    h\in\HH,
    \quad s\in\HH_0
  \\s < \beta(h)
  \end{gathered}
\]
imply that $p(sh)=p(s)p(h)$.

\begin{itenv}{Proposition 13}
\label{proposition:i-13}
  Let $s,S\in\bar{\HH}_0$.
  Then the relation $s\subs_{\bar{p}}S$ in $(\HH,\bar{p},\bar{\HH},\bar{\SS})$ imply that $s\subs_{p\bar{p}}(S)$ in $(\CC,p\bar{p},\bar{\HH},\bar{\SS})$.
\end{itenv}

\begin{proof}
  Set $\bar{j}=(S,\bar{p}(S)\bar{p}(s),s)\in\bar{\HH}$;
  we have that
  \[
    \bar{j}
    = \big(
      S, p\bar{p}(S)p\bar{p}(s), s
    \big)
  \]
  since we obtain the equality $p\bar{p}(\bar{j})=p\bar{p}(S)p\bar{p}(s)$ by using the relations
  \[
    \begin{gathered}
      p\bar{p}(\bar{j})
      = p\big(
        \bar{p}(S)\bar{p}(s)
      \big)
      < p\bar{p}(S)p\bar{p}(s),
    \\p\bar{p}(s)
      = \alpha\big(
        p\bar{p}(\bar{j})
      \big)
      < \alpha\big(
        p\bar{p}(S)p\bar{p}(s)
      \big)
      < p\bar{p}(s),
    \\p\bar{p}(S)
      = \beta\big(
        p\bar{p}(\bar{j})
      \big)
      < \beta\big(
        p\bar{p}(S)p\bar{p}(s)
      \big)
      < p\bar{p}(S).
    \end{gathered}
  \]
  Let $\bar{g}=(S,g,S')\in\bar{H}$, where $g\in\CC$, be such that
  \[
    \alpha\big(
      p\bar{p}(s)g
    \big) = \alpha(g)
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    \beta\big(
      p\bar{p}(s)g
    \big) = \beta(g).
  \]
  We will show that
  \[
    \big(
      s, p\bar{p}(s)g, S'
    \big)
    \in\bar{H}.
  \]
  \oldpage{375}
  Indeed, since $\bar{p}(s)<\bar{p}(\beta(\bar{g}))$, we have that
  \[
    p\big(
      \bar{p}(s)\bar{p}(\bar{g})
    \big)
    = p\bar{p}(s)p\bar{p}(\bar{g})
    = p\bar{p}(s)g;
  \]
  from the relations
  \[
    \begin{aligned}
      \alpha\big(
        \bar{p}(s)\bar{p}(\bar{g})
      \big)
      &< \bar{p}(S'),
    \\\beta\big(
        \bar{p}(s)\bar{p}(\bar{g})
      \big)
      &< \bar{p}(s),
    \\p\big(
        \alpha\big(
          \bar{p}(s)\bar{p}(\bar{g})
        \big)
      \big)
      &= p\big(
        \bar{p}(S')
      \big),
    \\p\big(
        \beta\big(
          \bar{p}(s)\bar{p}(\bar{g})
        \big)
      \big)
      &= p\big(
        \bar{p}(s)
      \big),
    \end{aligned}
  \]
  it follows that
  \[
    \alpha\big(
      \bar{p}(s)\bar{p}(\bar{g})
    \big)
    = \bar{p}(S')
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    \beta\big(
      \bar{p}(s)\bar{p}(\bar{g})
    \big)
    = \bar{p}(s).
  \]
  Since $s\subs S$ in $(\HH,\bar{p},\bar{\HH},\bar{\SS})$, we thus deduce that
  \[
    \big(
      s, \bar{p}(s)\bar{p}(\bar{g}), S'
    \big)
    = \big(
      s, p\bar{p}(s)g, S'
    \big)
    \in\HH.
  \]
  This proves that we have $s\subs_{p\bar{p}}S$ in $(\CC,p\bar{p},\bar{\HH},\bar{\SS})$.
\end{proof}

\begin{itenv}{Corollary 1}
  The conditions $h,h'\in\bar{\HH}$ and $h'\subs_{\bar{p}}h$ imply that $h'\subs_{p\bar{p}}h$.
\end{itenv}

\begin{itenv}{Corollary 2}
  If, for all $s,S\in\HH_0$ such that $s<S$, we have $\beta(Ss)=S$, then $s<S$ implies that $s\subs S$ in $(\CC,p,\HH,\SS)$.
\end{itenv}

\begin{proof}
  These conditions imply that we have $s\subs S$ in $(\HH,\Id_\HH,\HH,\HH)$, and the Corollary then follows from the Proposition.
\end{proof}

\begin{itenv}{Corollary 3}
  If $(\HH,\bar{p},\bar{\HH},\bar{\SS})$ is right solving, and if the following condition is satisfied:
  \begin{quote}
    For $h,h'\in\HH$ such that
    \[
      \alpha(h)=\alpha(h')
      \quad\text{and}\quad
      \beta(h)=\beta(h')
    \]
    we have that
    \[
      p(h\cap h')
      = p(h)\cap p(h')
    \]
  \end{quote}
  then $(\CC,p\bar{p},\bar{\HH},\bar{\SS})$ is right solving.
\end{itenv}

\begin{proof}
  Let $\bar{h},\bar{h}'\in\bar{\HH}$ be such that $\alpha(\bar{h})=\alpha(\bar{h}')$ and $\beta(\bar{h})=\beta(\bar{h}')$;
  let $s$ be the $\bar{p}$-kernel of $(\bar{h},\bar{h}')$;
  by the Proposition, we have that $s\subs S$ in $(\CC,p\bar{p},\bar{\HH},\bar{\SS})$.
  The relations
  \[
    \begin{aligned}
      \bar{p}(s)
      &= \alpha\big(\bar{p}(\bar{h})\cap\bar{p}(\bar{h}')\big)
    \\p\big(\bar{p}(\bar{h})\cap\bar{p}(\bar{h}')\big)
      &= p\bar{p}(\bar{h})\cap p\bar{p}(\bar{h}')
    \end{aligned}
  \]
  imply that $p\bar{p}(s)=\alpha(p\bar{p}(\bar{h})\cap p\bar{p}(\bar{h}'))$, and so $(\bar{h},\bar{h}')$ admits $s$ as a $p\bar{p}$-kernel, and $(\CC,p\bar{p},\bar{\HH},\bar{\SS})$ is right solving.
\end{proof}

\begin{itenv}{Corollary 4}
  Suppose that $s\relrhobar S$ in $(\CC,p,\HH,\SS)$ implies both that $s<S$ in $\HH_0$ and that $\beta(Ss)=S$;
  then the statement that $\bar{s}\subs_{p\bar{p}}\bar{S}$ in $(\CC,p\bar{p},\bar{\HH},\bar{\SS})$ is equivalent to $\bar{s}\subs_{\bar{p}}\bar{S}$ in $(\HH,\bar{p},\bar{\HH},\bar{\SS})$.
\end{itenv}

\oldpage{376}
\begin{proof}
  Indeed, $\bar{s}\subs_{\bar{p}}\bar{S}$ implies that $\bar{s}\subs_{p\bar{p}}\bar{S}$ by \hyperref[proposition:i-13]{Proposition~13}.
  Suppose that $\bar{s}\subs_{p\bar{p}}\bar{S}$;
  since
  \[
    \bar{j}
    = \big(
      \bar{S}, p\bar{p}(\bar{S})p\bar{p}(\bar{s}), \bar{s}
    \big)
    \in \bar{\HH}
  \]
  we have that
  \[
    \begin{aligned}
      \bar{p}(\bar{j})
      &= \big(
        \bar{p}(\bar{S}), p\bar{p}(\bar{S})p\bar{p}(\bar{s}), \bar{p}(\bar{s})
      \big)
      \in\HH
    \\p\bar{p}(\bar{s})
      &< p\bar{p}(\bar{S}),
    \end{aligned}
  \]
  whence $\bar{p}(\bar{s})\relrhobar\bar{p}(\bar{S})$.
  Then $\bar{p}(\bar{s})<\bar{p}(\bar{S})$ in $\HH$, and
  \[
    \beta\big(
      \bar{p}(\bar{S})\bar{p}(\bar{s})
    \big)
    = \bar{p}(\bar{S}).
  \]
  \hyperref[proposition:i-12]{Proposition~12} then implies that $\bar{s}\subs_{\bar{p}}\bar{S}$.
\end{proof}
